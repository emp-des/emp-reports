With assistance from the California Department of Water Resources (CDFW), each month EMP scientists visit up to 28 (24 fixed and 4 floating) stations to sample water quality and biological communities (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates). EMP also services and maintains a network of 15 continuous water quality stations that provide data in real time through the California Data Exchange Network. Since 1975, these efforts have established an irreplaceable ecological record in the San Francisco estuary that has been used in dozens of peer-review scientific articles and technical reports. As a public endeavor, EMP embraces the principles of Open Science and makes the data it collects openly and freely available. This website provides yearly status-and-trends reports on water quality, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates while also providing links to Environmental Data Initiative portals where quality-checked versions of EMPs various datasets are available for download. For questions and comments about the website, please contact Sarah Perry (sarah.perry@water.ca.gov) at DWR. Program History EMP was formed in response to water quality objectives set by Californias State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to protect beneficial uses of water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, Suisun, and San Pablo Bays. The data collected and analyzed by EMP scientists is essential for the effective management of water resources in the estuary and assures that the objectives mandated by SWRCB in the permits issued to DWR and UBSR are met. The standards include minimum Delta outflows, limits to Delta water export by the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), and maximum allowable salinity levels in the Delta. The regulatory basis for what became EMP began in 1971 when the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) established new water quality requirements for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary in Water Right Decision 1379 (D-1379). This decision provided the terms and conditions for a comprehensive monitoring program to evaluate changes in environmental conditions within the estuary. A monitoring program was first implemented in 1971 following the design laid out by the Stanford Research Institute (SWRCB Publication 40). These water quality standards were amended in 1978 (D-1485) and again in 1999 (D-1641). The SWP and CVP are currently operated to comply with the requirements of the latter. The annual reports displayed on this website constitute the annual reports submitted to SWRCB by DWR and USBR in fulfillment of the D-1641 reporting requirement.

As primary consumers of phytoplankton, zooplankton facilitate the flow of carbon into a large and complex food web, historically supporting abundant fisheries in the region (Schroeter et al. 2015; Kimmerer et al. 2018). Many fishes, including Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) and Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) feed on zooplankton while rearing in the estuary as larvae and juveniles (Goertler et al. 2018; Heubach et al. 1963), while others like Tule Perch (Hysterocarpus traski) and Prickly Sculpin (Cottus asper) feed on zooplankton throughout their lifetimes (Kimmerer 2006, Feyrer et al. 2003). Zooplankton in the SFE are also a key food source for several endangered and threatened species, notably the Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) (Hobbs et al. 2006; Slater and Baxter 2014). This importance of zooplankton prompted the implementation of the Zooplankton Study in 1972 to assess fish food resources in the upper SFE. Mandated by the State Water Resources Control Boards Water Right Decision D-1641, the study is conducted jointly by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Department of Water Resources under the guidance and management of the Interagency Ecological Program. For nearly 5 decades, this study has monitored the zooplankton community in the region, tracking abundance trends and distributional patterns, detecting and monitoring introduced species, and documenting the dramatic shifts in the communitys composition. Changes in zooplankton abundance and composition have since been linked to major declines of the pelagic fishes in the upper estuary (Sommer et al. 2007; Winder and Jassby 2011). Methods Zooplankton sampling has been conducted since 1974 at least once a month March-November through 1995, and monthly from 1995 through the present, at 20 fixed stations in the upper SFE (Figure 69). Three gear types are used for each sampling event: a pump with a 43-micron mesh net for micro-zooplankton (rotifers, nauplii, and small cyclopoid copepods); a Clarke-Bumpus (CB) net with a 160-micron mesh for sampling meso-zooplankton (cladocera and most juvenile and adult calanoid copepods); and a mysid net with a 505-micron mesh for sampling mysid shrimp and other macro-zooplankton. Both the mysid and CB nets are attached to a sled and towed obliquely from the bottom through the surface for a 10-minute tow. Volume is measured using a General Oceanics flowmeter placed in the mouth of each net so that: \\(V = (end meter - startmeter)k*a\\) where \\(V\\) is the volume of water sampled (mL), \\(k\\) is a flow meter collection value, and \\(a\\) is the area of the mouth of the net (mm\\(^2\\)). The Teel Marine 12V utility pump is also used at each station to sample approximately 19.8 gallons from the entire water column, which is filtered through a 43-micron mesh net to concentrate the pump sample. Samples are preserved in 10% formalin with Rose Bengal dye before being processed in the laboratory for identification and enumeration of organisms using a dissecting microscope. More information about the sampling and processing methods can be found in the metadata at here. Abundance indices are calculated for each organism based on the gear type most effective at its capture and reported as the mean catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE). CPUE is calculated as the number of each organism collected per cubic meter of water sampled, so that: Volume is measured using a General Oceanics flowmeter placed in the mouth of each net so that: \\(CPUE=s*V^{-1}\\) where \\(s\\) is the estimated count of the target organism in the sample. Copepod abundance indices reported here only include adults, as juveniles were not always identified to species. Annual and seasonal abundance indices were calculated using 14 fixed stations sampled consistently since 1974 (Figure 67) and 2 non-fixed stations sampled where bottom specific conductance was roughly 2 and 6 millisiemens per centimeter (approximately 1 and 3 psu). To analyze long-term trends (1974 to present), annual abundance indices were calculated as the mean CPUE for samples collected from March through November, as winter sampling was inconsistent before 1995. Seasonal abundance indices were calculated as the mean CPUE for samples collected during each season: winter (previous December to February), spring (March to May), summer (June to August), and fall (September to November). Long-term seasonal trends for winter are only shown for 1995 to present. Spatial distribution indices for organisms is described as seasonal mean CPUE for by region. Estuary regions were defined as San Pablo Bay (stations D41 and D41A), Suisun Bay (stations D6, 28, 54, and 48), Suisun Marsh (stations 32 and S42), West Delta (stations 60, 64, and 74), Central Delta (stations D16, 86, and D28), and the East Delta (92 and M10). COVID Note: due to the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic, zooplankton sampling was not conducted from March 2020 - April 2020, and December 2020 - February 2021. Figure 1: Map of fixed Zooplankton Study stations in the San Francisco Estuary. "],["zoop-report.html", "Current Report", " Current Report Introduction This report presents zooplankton annual and seasonal abundance indices and distribution trends from 1974 through 2021 for the most common copepods, cladocera, rotifers, and mysids of the upper estuary. Trends Since the implementation of the Zooplankton Study in 1974, a significant decrease in the overall abundance of zooplankton has been detected in the estuary (Figure 68). Only the abundance of cyclopoid copepods increased in the region during this period, driven by the invasion and spread of Limnoithona tetraspina. The overall decrease in zooplankton abundance in the estuary can be attributed to a series of invasions into the estuary, most notably that of the Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis in the mid-1980s (Kimmerer, Gartside, and Orsi 1994; Carlton et al. 1990). The spread of P. amurensis throughout SFE has had significant impacts on planktonic abundance in the upper estuary due to its high filtration feeding rates on phytoplankton and copepod nauplii. Not only has abundance decreased for most of the zooplankton groups, but dramatic shifts in the composition of these communities have been detected during the study period. These changes have been driven by the introduction and spread of non-native zooplankton species throughout the estuary, compounded with changes to the abiotic and biotic environments. Calanoid copepods While overall calanoid copepod abundance has declined slightly over the study period, community composition has shifted dramatically (Figure 68A). When the study began in the early 1970s the copepods Eurytemora affinis and Acartia spp. dominated the calanoid community. The non-native E. affinis was once the primary prey item of the endangered Delta Smelt, but its abundance has declined to a fraction of what it once was, forcing fish to prey switch to more recently introduced calanoids like Pseudodiaptomus forbesi (Moyle et al. 1992; Slater and Baxter 2014). One of the first recorded introduced calanoid copepods was Sinocalanus doerrii, a freshwater species native to China that invaded the estuary in 1978 and became the most dominant calanoid species in the estuary for a decade (Orsi et al. 1983). Then in 1987, after the invasion of P. amurensis, the calanoid Pseudodiaptomus forbesi was introduced and first detected in the region, competing with the abundant E. affinis (Orsi and Walter 1991). P. forbesi quickly became the numerically dominant calanoid in the upper estuary and remains the most abundant to this day. Another introduction occurred in 1993, when the predatory calanoid copepod Acartiella sinensis quickly became the second most abundant calanoid in the upper estuary, dominating the low-salinity zone in Suisun and the West Delta (Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999). This invasion was hypothesized to have narrowed the range of P. forbesi and calanoid copeopds towards the freshwater zone of the estuary (Figure 69A), as predation on P. forbesi nauplii by A. sinensis has been recorded (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017). In general, calanoid copepod abundance is highest in the estuary during the summer and fall months, with lowest abundances during the winter (Figure 70A). While calanoid copepod abundance peaked in the summer of 2017 at a 20 year high, 2018 through 2021 abundance returned to levels comparable to the previous two decades. In 2021 the distribution of calanoids throughout the estuary was similar to the last two years, with P. forbesi the most abundant in summer and fall in most of the upper estuary (Figure 70A). The predatory Acartiella sinensis was seen in highest densities in the summer and fall mostly in the West Delta, with lower abundances in the Suisun Bay and Suisun Marsh regions compared to 2020. In the summer and fall of 2021, A. sinensis was the most abundant calanoid in Suisun and the West Delta, where it co-occurred with high densities of one of its primary prey item Limnoithona tetraspina (Figure 70B), while P. forbesi was most abundant in the Central and East Delta. The shift of density for P. forbesi upstream out of Suisun Marsh could be due to the ongoing drought conditions in the estuary. Acartia spp. was the only native calanoid copepod commonly found in 2021, but it was restricted to Suisun Bay and San Pablo Bay in the lower reaches of the estuary. Eurytemora affinis was most dominant calanoid in the estuary in the spring of 2021, similar to seasonal distribution patterns of the last two decades.

Cyclopoid copepods While overall zooplankton abundance has declined over the study period, the abundance of cyclopoid copepods has exploded (Figure 68B). The native Oithona spp. and Acanthocyclops copepods were at low abundances when the study began, but with the introduction of Limnoithona sinensis in the early 1980s, and the later identification of the invasive Limnoithona tetraspina in 1993, cyclopoid indices have increased dramatically (Ferrari and Orsi 1984; Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999). Abundance indices for the two species of Limnoithona were reported together from 1980 through 2006 as Limnoithona spp., then separately since 2007 when they were identified and enumerated as L. sinensis and L. tetraspina. For the sake of consistency, both have been summed as Limnoithona spp. in figures for this report. In 2021, Limnoithona spp. abundance was the highest observed for all zooplankton (Figure 68B). Much smaller than calanoid copepods collected in the CB net, the Limnoithona cyclopoids are best retained in pump samples, which use a smaller mesh. Since the early 1990s, Limnoithona spp. abundance has been higher than calanoid copepod abundance, and the small L. tetraspina has become the most common zooplankton in the upper estuary. This increase in L. tetraspina abundance is likely due to a decline of Northern Anchovy in the upper SFE and subsequent decreased predation (Kimmerer 2006), as well as the cyclopoids small size, high growth rate, and motionless behavior, making it very difficult for visual feeders to capture (Bouley and Kimmerer 2006; Greene et al. 2011). These characteristics may increase its ability to escape predation in a region where visual predation is most dominant among fish (Kimmerer 2006). The introduction of L. tetraspina is also linked to the reduction of the range of P. forbesi out of the low-salinity zone of the estuary, as high L. tetraspina densities may have fed and sustained larger populations of the predatory A. sinensis, which also feed on P. forbesi nauplii (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017). Seasonally, Limnoithona tetraspina peaks in summer and fall (Figure 69B), with lower abundance in winter and spring. As in prior years, these cyclopoids were most abundant in the low-salinity zone of the estuary in Suisun Bay and the West Delta (Figure 70B). Oithona davisae, a native cyclopoid, was the most abundant cyclopoid in the higher-salinity San Pablo Bay in summer and fall (Figure 70B). Cladocera The cladoceran community of the upper estuary is composed of Bosmina, Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, and Diaphanosoma species, whose populations have also substantially declined since the onset of the study (Figure 68C). These cladocera tend to be herbivorous, feeding primarily on phytoplankton, and were likely hard hit by the invasion of P. amurensis (Baxter et al. 2008; Kratina and Winder 2015). Cladocerans make up a significant portion in the diets of Delta Smelt, juvenile Chinook Salmon, and young-of-the-year Striped Bass throughout the upper estuary (Heubach et al. 1963; Slater and Baxter 2014; Goertler et al. 2018). The invasion and increase of available copepod prey such as P. forbesi and the decline in cladocera has created a shift in the nutritional content of the plankton community available for fish, with yet to be determined consequences (Kratina and Winder 2015). While Cladocera abundance has declined overall since the study began, recent years abundance has been increasing above the lowest levels found in the 1990s (Figure 69C). In the high outflow year of 2017 some cladocera, namely Bosmina, were found downstream in Suisun and the West Delta, but in 2021 the highest densities of cladocera were found in the East Delta, with trace concentrations found in other regions of the estuary (Figure 70C). Figure 4: Seasonal mean zooplankton CPUE. Spring, summer, and fall are reported for 1974-2018, winter is reported for 1995-2019. A) Calanoid CPUE in the CB net. B) Cyclopoida CPUE in pump samples. C) Cladocera CPUE in the CB net. D) Rotifer CPUE in pump samples. E) Mysid CPUE in the mysid net Rotifer While they are the most abundant zooplankton in the estuary, long-term sampling of rotifers shows a dramatic decrease in their annual abundance in the estuary since the beginning of this study (Figure 68D). Several species of rotifers make up the community: most abundant being the Polyarthra, Synchaeta, and Keratella genera. Interestingly, the decline of rotifer abundance beginning in the late 1970s preceded the invasion of P. amurensis in the estuary (Cloern and Jassby 2012). The distribution and abundance of rotifers were similar in 2021 to previous years, with abundances similar to those found since the invasion of P. amurensis. Overall rotifer abundance peaked in the summer and spring (Figure 69D). Keratella and Polyarthra tend to be most abundant in the freshwater and low-salinity zone of the estuary, while Synchaeta species are most abundant in the higher-salinity areas of San Pablo Bay and Suisun (Winder and Jassby 2011). A spatial and temporal split was discernible between Synchaeta and other rotifers, with Synchaeta having highest densities in the low-salinity zone Bay during the spring, and other rotifers being most abundant in the East Delta in summer. Mysida Not only have mysid abundances declined significantly since the 1970s, but the community has also shifted from being composed almost entirely by the native Neomysis mercedis, to being dominated by the non-native Hyperacanthomysis longirostris (formerly Acanthomysis bowmani) (Figure 68E). The first significant decline in N. mercedis occurred during the 1976-1977 drought, likely caused by food limitation from an absence of diatoms due to very low river discharges (Siegfried et al. 1979; Cloern et al. 1983). The populations of N. mercedis were able to rebound after the years of drought and stayed at high densities in the Suisun Bay region of the upper estuary until the introduction of P. amurensis in the mid-1980s, after which their numbers crashed. In 1993 the introduced H. longirostris was first detected by this study, shortly after the decline of N. mercedis, and it quickly became the most common mysid in the system. However, overall mysid abundances have not returned to their pre-clam invasion levels (Modlin and Orsi 1997, Figure 68E). Mysids have always peaked in the spring and summer months, fluctuating with the higher productivity in the estuary during those seasons (Figure 69E). Historically mysids have been of critical importance in the diets of many fish species in the SFE including Delta Smelt, Longfin Smelt, Striped Bass, and Chinook Salmon (Moyle et al. 1992; Feyrer et al. 2003; CDFG 2009; Goertler et al. 2018). However, the decline of mysids in the upper estuary has resulted in a significant decrease in their presence in the diets of fishes of the region (Feyrer et al. 2003). These low abundances have continued, even though 2021 saw a slight increase in overall mysid abundance compared to the previous few years (Figure 68E), and the distribution and timing of peaks stayed similar over the last two decades (Hennessy 2018). Hyperacanthomysis longirostris was again the most common mysid in the estuary during all seasons, while the once common and native Neomysis mercedis continued to be almost imperceptible in the region. This has been the overall trend in the estuarys mysid communities since 1994. As in prior years, mysids in 2021 were most abundant during the summer and fall (Figure 69E), and highest concentrations occurred in the low-salinity zone of Suisun and the West Delta (Figure 70E). Figure 5: Seasonal mean zooplankton CPUE for reporting year by region for A) Calanoid CPUE in the CB net, B) Cyclopoida CPUE in pump samples, C) Cladocera CPUE in the CB net, D) Rotifer CPUE in pump samples, and E) Mysid CPUE in the mysid net. Conclusion In 2021 the Zooplankton Study recorded the abundances of calanoids, cladocera, rotifers, and mysids at lower densities comparable to other recent years and consistent with the downward historic trends in the estuary. Abundances for all zooplankton peaked in summer for 2021. The small, abundant Limnoithona tetraspina was again the most abundant copepod in the upper estuary, and has also become the most abundance zooplankton in the upper estuary. This multi-decade zooplankton study has enabled researchers and managers to track the shifts in zooplankton abundances and community composition across the estuary for nearly 5 decades. The Zooplankton Study has documented the introduction and dominance of Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, Limnoithona tetraspina, and Hypercanthomysis longirostris, as well as the communitys response to the invasive clam Potamocorbula amurensis. Understanding these dynamics and how they have fundamentally changed trophic interactions is critical to assessing food resources for fish and conservation strategies in the San Francisco Estuary.

"],["veliger.html", "Veliger Monitoring Program Background Sampling Protocols Contact Info", " Veliger Monitoring Program Background The Zebra/Quagga Mussel Veliger Monitoring Program monitors zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (Dreissena bugensis) mussel abundance within the Delta. These species were first discovered in Lakes St. Clair and Erie in 1988 and have since expanded their geographic distribution into many other freshwater systems in North America. These mussels were introduced into the Great Lakes by means of discharged ballast water from transoceanic ships that may have contained mussel larvae or possibly juveniles. While zebra and quagga mussels have not been detected in or near the California Delta, the Department of Water Resources Zebra and Quagga Mussel Early Detection Monitoring Program aims to monitor the potential spread of zebra and quagga mussels in California waterways. The first stage of the mussel lifecycle is called a veliger, which is a free-swimming planktonic larva that develops miniature bivalve shells and feeds by utilizing its hair-like cilia. Veligers drift with the currents and eventually settle onto hard substrates using sticky secretions. Once settled, they are considered juveniles that eventually develop to sexual maturity, becoming adult mussels after about a year of growth. Zebra and quagga mussels have negative impacts on aquatic food webs by filtering increased amounts of phytoplankton, which then creates a food source deficiency for organisms in higher trophic levels. They also excrete unwanted particulate matter (pseudofeces) that undergoes decomposition, which causes oxygen levels to decrease and toxic byproducts (ammonia and hydrogen sulfide) to be released into the water. Zebra and quagga mussels also influence industrial processes by colonizing hard surfaces, placing potential limitations on pumping plants for water distribution. This program sets out to monitor any traces of zebra and quagga mussel veliger DNA throughout the California water system to prevent the negative effects associated with the spread of these introduced mussels. Figure 6: Map of veliger monitoring stations for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region. Sampling Protocols While this program includes many other regions and sampling methods, the map and sampling protocols listed here are specific to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region. Sampling for this region takes place once a month at each of the three monitoring stations displayed on the map. At each station, a 45-meter horizontal surface tow is conducted using a 64-micron mesh plankton net. The material collected at the cod end of the net is that of which cannot pass through the 64-micron mesh. These particulates are rinsed into a sample container and submitted to a laboratory for PCR analysis, which determines presence/absence of zebra/quagga mussel veliger DNA. In order to sample all three stations in one day, some nets require decontamination in the field prior to reuse. This decontamination process consists of soaking each net in vinegar for a minimum of one hour and then spraying all surfaces of the net with a 10% bleach solution.

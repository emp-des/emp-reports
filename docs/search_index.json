Program Information The Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) is a joint effort by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) to characterize the aquatic environment of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, Suisun, and San Pablo Bays. With assistance from the California Department of Water Resources (CDFW), each month EMP scientists visit up to 28 (24 fixed and 4 floating) stations to sample water quality and biological communities (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates). EMP also services and maintains a network of 15 continuous water quality stations that provide data in real time through the California Data Exchange Network. Since 1975, these efforts have established an irreplaceable ecological record in the San Francisco estuary that has been used in dozens of peer-review scientific articles and technical reports. As a public endeavor, EMP embraces the principles of Open Science and makes the data it collects openly and freely available. This website provides yearly status-and-trends reports on water quality, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates while also providing links to Environmental Data Initiative portals where quality-checked versions of EMPs various datasets are available for download. For questions and comments about the website, please contact Sarah Perry (sarah.perry@water.ca.gov) at DWR. Program History EMP was formed in response to water quality objectives set by Californias State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to protect beneficial uses of water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, Suisun, and San Pablo Bays. The data collected and analyzed by EMP scientists is essential for the effective management of water resources in the estuary and assures that the objectives mandated by SWRCB in the permits issued to DWR and UBSR are met. The standards include minimum Delta outflows, limits to Delta water export by the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), and maximum allowable salinity levels in the Delta. The regulatory basis for what became EMP began in 1971 when the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) established new water quality requirements for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary in Water Right Decision 1379 (D-1379). This decision provided the terms and conditions for a comprehensive monitoring program to evaluate changes in environmental conditions within the estuary. A monitoring program was first implemented in 1971 following the design laid out by the Stanford Research Institute (SWRCB Publication 40). These water quality standards were amended in 1978 (D-1485) and again in 1999 (D-1641). The SWP and CVP are currently operated to comply with the requirements of the latter. The annual reports displayed on this website constitute the annual reports submitted to SWRCB by DWR and USBR in fulfillment of the D-1641 reporting requirement.

Regional facet graphs for 2022 were created for each parameter. The minimum and maximum values were determined for each field parameter or laboratory analyte to show that years range; instances when a result fell below the reporting limit were excluded from these minimum and maximum calculations. When this occurred, for the corresponding graph, a vertical dashed line capped at the reporting limit was used to represent the presence of a non-detect. Specific Conductance Surface specific conductance varied greatly in 2022 across the sampling regions with the highest levels occurring in the western regions (San Pablo Bay, Suisun &amp; Grizzly Bays, Confluence) due to the strong marine influence from the Pacific Ocean. Surface specific conductance ranged from 119 S/cm (C3A in Northern Interior Delta, August) to 44933 S/cm (D41 in San Pablo Bay, October) in 2022. Average specific conductance values in 2022 ( = 44933 S/cm) were lower than the 2021 average ( = 46189 S/cm). Figure 3: TEST Turbidity Surface turbidity values ranged from 0.9 FNU (MD10A in Southern Interior Delta, November) to 109.3 FNU (NZS42 in Suisun &amp; Grizzly Bays, April) in 2022. Average turbidity values in 2022 ( = 109.3 FNU) were lower than the 2021 average ( = 111.3 FNU). TEST2 Dissolved Ammonia Dissolved ammonia levels in 2022 ranged from &lt; 0.05 mg/L (the reporting limit) to 0.29 mg/L (P8 in Southern Interior Delta, January) in 2022. Ammonia levels are typically lower throughout the Delta and Bays, likely due to dilution and nitrification. Average dissolved ammonia values in 2022 ( = 0.29 mg/L) were lower than the 2021 average ( = 0.3 mg/L). Chlorophyll a Chlorophyll a values in 2022 ranged from &lt; 0.5 /L (the reporting limit) to 49.8 /L (NZ325 in San Pablo Bay, August) in 2022. The highest levels of chlorophyll a were seen in the San Pablo Bay region during August. This was due to a harmful algal bloom of Heterosigma akashiwo. More information about the phytoplankton genera is described in the phytoplankton section. Dissolved Nitrate + Nitrite Dissolved nitrate + nitrite levels in 2022 ranged from &lt; 0.05 mg/L (the reporting limit) to 5.47 mg/L (P8 in Southern Interior Delta, February) in 2022. The Southern Interior Delta region had the highest fluctuation of dissolved nitrate + nitrite concentrations and had the highest levels compared to the rest of the estuary, likely due to influence from nearby agricultural land use and wastewater treatment effluent. Total Phosphorus Total phosphorus levels in 2022 ranged from &lt; 0.05 mg/L (the reporting limit) to 5.47 mg/L (P8 in Southern Interior Delta, February) in 2022. The Southern Interior Delta region had the highest fluctuation of total phosphorus concentrations and had the highest levels compared to the rest of the estuary, likely due to influence from nearby agricultural land use and wastewater treatment effluent. "],["00-phyto-report.html", "Current Report", " Current Report Introduction The Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) are required by Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) to collect phytoplankton and chlorophyll a samples to monitor algal community composition and biomass at select sites in the upper San Francisco Estuary (Estuary). The twenty-four sites range from San Pablo Bay to the inland rivers of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (the Delta). These sites represent a variety of aquatic habitats, from narrow, freshwater channels to broad, estuarine bays. This report describes the results of these monitoring efforts for calendar year 2022. Phytoplankton are small, free-floating organisms that occur as unicellular, colonial, or filamentous forms (Horne and Goldman, 1994). Phytoplankton are a key component of the Estuarys food web, serving as food for zooplankton, invertebrates, and certain fish species. Their metabolic processes also impact water chemistry, and their ability to fix carbon through photosynthesis is one of the key processes influencing water quality in the Estuary. Via this process, phytoplankton can affect the pH, dissolved oxygen, color, taste, and odor of natural waters. Under certain conditions, some species of phytoplankton (e.g., Microcystis aeruginosa) can cause harmful algal blooms (HABs), releasing toxin compounds which can be dangerous or even lethal to animals and humans (Carmichael, 1981). In freshwater, the cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae (class Cyanophyceae), are responsible for producing toxic blooms, particularly in waters that are polluted with phosphates (van den Hoek et al., 1995). Phytoplankton are also useful for assessing water quality (Gannon and Stemberger 1978); their short life cycles allow them to respond quickly to environmental changes, meaning their standing crop and species composition are indicative of source water characteristics (APHA 2012). However, because of their transient nature, patchiness, and free movement in a lotic environment, the utility of phytoplankton as water quality indicators is limited and should be interpreted in conjunction with other biological and physiochemical data (APHA 2012). In addition to collecting phytoplankton samples to assess community composition, we use the measured concentration of chlorophyll a as a proxy to infer phytoplankton biomass. Chlorophyll molecules are complex phytopigments found in most photosynthetic organisms. There are several types of chlorophyll, which are distinguished by slight differences in their molecular structures and constituents. These include chlorophyll a, b, c, and d, with a being the principal photosynthetic pigment in most phytoplankton. This makes the chlorophyll a pigment a reliable proxy measurement for phytoplankton biomass. In addition, we measured the concentration of a different pigment in our water samples, pheophytin a. Pheophytin a is a primary degradation product of chlorophyll a. Comparing its concentration relative to chlorophyll a is a useful metric for estimating the general physiological state of phytoplankton populations. When phytoplankton are actively growing, the concentrations of pheophytin a are normally expected to be low relative to chlorophyll a. Conversely, when the phytoplankton have died and are decaying, levels of pheophytin a are expected to be high in relation to chlorophyll a. Phytoplankton biomass and the resulting amount of chlorophyll a in some areas of the Estuary may be influenced by extensive filtration of the water column by the introduced Asian clam, Potamocorbula amurensis (Alpine and Cloern 1992). Well-established benthic populations of P. amurensis in Suisun and San Pablo bays are thought to have contributed to the low chlorophyll a concentrations (and increased water clarity) measured in these westerly bays since the mid-1980s (Alpine and Cloern 1992). Primary production by phytoplankton, primarily via carbon fixation through photosynthesis, is one of the key processes that influence water quality in the Estuary. Via this process, phytoplankton can affect pH, dissolved oxygen, color, taste, and odor. Under certain conditions, some species (eg. Microcystis aeruginosa) can cause harmful algal blooms (HABs), resulting in animal deaths and human illness (Carmichael, 1981). In freshwater, the cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae (class Cyanophyceae), are responsible for producing toxic blooms, particularly in waters that are polluted with phosphates (van den Hoek et al., 1995). Phytoplankton are also useful for assessing water quality (Gannon and Stemberger 1978); their short life cycles allow them to respond quickly to environmental changes, meaning their standing crop and species composition are indicative of source water characteristics (APHA 2012). However, because of their transient nature, patchiness, and free movement in a lotic environment, the utility of phytoplankton as water quality indicators is limited and should be interpreted in conjunction with other biological and physio-chemical data (APHA 2012). Methods Phytoplankton Phytoplankton samples were collected monthly at 24 monitoring sites throughout the Upper Estuary, which were grouped into regions based on their geographic location (Figure x; Table x). Sampling occurred from March through December; sampling for January and February were cancelled because of the COVID pandemic. Samples were collected 1 meter below the waters surface using a submersible pump and stored in 50 mL amber glass bottles. 200 µL of Lugols solution was added to each sample as a stain and preservative. All samples were kept at room temperature and away from direct sunlight until they were analyzed. Phytoplankton identification and enumeration were performed by BSA Environmental, Inc. according to the Utermöhl microscopic method (Utermöhl, 1958) and modified Standard Methods (APHA, 2012). An aliquot of sample was placed into a counting chamber and allowed to settle for a minimum of 12 hours. The aliquot volume, normally 10-20 mL, was adjusted according to the algal population density and the turbidity of the sample. Phytoplankton taxa were enumerated in randomly chosen transects for each settled aliquot. This process was performed at 800x magnification using a Leica DMIL inverted microscope. For each aliquot, a minimum of 400 total algal units were counted, with the dominant taxon accounting for a minimum of 100 algal units. For filamentous or colonial taxa, the number of cells per filament or colony was recorded. Raw organism counts were normalized to the sample volume using the following formula: \\(organisms/mL = {CA_c \\frac V{A_f}F}\\) where \\(C\\) is the organism count, \\(A_c\\) is the area of the cell bottom (mm\\(^2\\)), \\(A_f\\) is the area of each grid field (mm\\(^2\\)), \\(F\\) is the number of fields examined, and \\(V\\) is the settled volume (mL). This simplifies to: \\(organisms/mL = {\\frac C{cV}}\\) where \\(cV = {A_c \\frac V{A_f}F}\\) and is equal to the counted volume. The 10 most common genera were determined by summing the normalized organism counts across all stations and months for each genus. For the bar graphs, average organism counts were calculated per month, per region, and normalized to the number of stations.

Sampling occurred from March through December; sampling for January and February were cancelled because of the COVID pandemic. Samples were collected by filtering a known volume of water through a glass-fiber filter (1.0 µm pore size) at a pressure of 10 mmHg. For turbid water (&gt; 20 NTU), 200 mL was filtered while 500mL of water was filtered when turbidity was &lt; 20 NTU to prevent clogging. Filters were immediately frozen and transported to DWRs Bryte Laboratory for analysis using spectrophotometry in accordance with the Standard Method 10200 H (APHA, 2012). Samples were processed by mechanically grinding the filter and extracting phytopigments using acetone. Pigment absorption spectra were measured before and after acidification to quantify the amount of chlorophyll a and pheophytin a, respectively. Concentrations were calculated according to a formula specified in the methodology (APHA, 2012). Average analyte concentrations were then calculated per month, per region, and were normalized to the number of stations. Results Phytoplankton Identification All organisms collected in 2022 fell into these 10 algal groups:  Chrysophytes Cryptophytes Cyanobacteria Diatoms (Pennate and Centric) Dinoflagellates Euglenoids Green Algae Haptophytes Raphidophytes The 10 most common genera collected in 2022 were, in order: Eucapsis (cyanobacteria) Cyclotella (centric diatoms) Plagioselmis (cryptophytes) Nitzschia (pennate diatoms) Chlorella (green algae) Cocconeis (cyanobacteria) Teleaulax (centric diatoms) Cryptomonas (cryptophytes) Monoraphidium (pennate diatoms) Navicula (green algae) Of the 10 groups identified, cryptophytes, cyanobacteria, diatoms, and green algae constituted the vast majority (97.7%) of the organisms collected. Pigment Concentrations Some stations showed seasonal patterns in chlorophyll a concentration, while others did not. Most maxima occurred in spring and summer, while minima occurred in fall or winter. Monthly chlorophyll a concentrations throughout much of the estuary were low relative to historic levels. Of the 329 samples taken in 2022, 97.9% (320 samples) had chlorophyll a levels below 10 g/L. Chlorophyll a levels below 10 g/L are considered limiting for zooplankton growth (Müller-Solger et al., 2002). Of the 7 samples with chlorophyll a concentrations equal to or above 10 g/L, one occurred at NZ325 in April; three occurred in August (NZ002, NZ004, and NZ325); one occurred at NZ325 in February; one occurred at D10 in March; and one occurred at D41A in May. The median chlorophyll a concentration for all samples in 2022 was 2.08 g/L; this is lower than in 2021 (median = 2.37 g/L). The maximum concentration was 49.8 g/L (recorded at NZ325 in August); this is higher than in 2021 (max = 25.51 g/L). The minimum concentration was &lt; 0.5 g/L (the reporting limit); this is identical to 2021 (min = &lt; 0.5 g/L). 8 samples were below the reporting limit. The median pheophytin a concentration for all samples in 2022 was 0.88 g/L; this is lower than in 2021 (median = 1.04 g/L). The maximum concentration was 6.47 g/L (recorded at NZS42 in April); this is lower than in 2021 (max = 11.08 g/L). The minimum concentration was &lt; 0.5 g/L (the reporting limit); this is identical to 2021 (min = &lt; 0.5 g/L). 64 samples were below the reporting limit. Northern Interior Delta Chlorophyll a average concentrations were higher in early spring and lower the rest of the year (Figure 3). The median chlorophyll a concentration for the Northern Interior Delta in 2022 was 1.15 g/L. The maximum concentration was 3.06 g/L (recorded at NZ068 in August). The minimum concentration was 0.53 g/L (recorded at C3A in November). 0 samples were below the reporting limit. Pheophytin a average concentrations were low throughout the year (below 1.5 µg/L); values were generally lower than chlorophyll a (Figure 3). The median pheophytin a concentration for the Northern Interior Delta in 2022 was 0.52 g/L. The maximum concentration was 2.94 g/L (recorded at C3A in January). The minimum concentration was &lt; 0.5 g/L (the reporting limit). 11 samples were below the reporting limit. Phytoplankton average densities were highest in spring and summer, with cyanobacteria dominating throughout the year (Figure 4; \"other\" are cryptophytes, cyanobacteria, dinoflagellates, euglenoids, and green algae). There was a peak of cryptophytes in March, with smaller peaks occurring again in July and August. There was a small peak of diatoms in November.

The maximum concentration was 11.5 g/L (recorded at D10 in March). The minimum concentration was 0.54 g/L (recorded at D4 in January). 0 samples were below the reporting limit. Pheophytin a average concentrations were relatively consistent throughout the year and lower than chlorophyll a concentrations except for the last three months of the year (Figure 9). The median pheophytin a concentration for the Confluence in 2022 was 0.84 g/L. The maximum concentration was 2.95 g/L (recorded at D12 in February).

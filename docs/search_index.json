The State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) sets water quality objectives to protect beneficial uses of water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta and Suisun and San Pablo Bays. These objectives are met by establishing standards mandated in water right permits issued to the Department of Water Resources and U.S. Bureau of Reclamation by the SWRCB. The standards include minimum Delta outflows, limits to Delta water export by the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), and maximum allowable salinity levels. In 1971, the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) established Water Right Decision 1379 (D-1379). This Decision contained new water quality requirements for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary. D-1379 was also the first water right decision to provide terms and conditions for a comprehensive monitoring program to routinely determine water quality conditions and changes in environmental conditions within the estuary. The monitoring program described in D-1379 was developed by the Stanford Research Institute through a contract with the SWRCB. Implementation of the monitoring program began in 1972, as SWRCB, DWR, and USBR met to define their individual responsibilities for various elements of the monitoring program. In 1978, amendments to water quality standards were implemented and resulted in Water Right Decision 1485 (D-1485). These standards were again amended under the 1995 Water Quality Control Plan and Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) established in 1999. The SWP and CVP are currently operated to comply with the monitoring and reporting requirements described in D-1641. D-1641 requires DWR and USBR to conduct a comprehensive environmental monitoring program to determine compliance with the water quality standards and also to submit an annual report to the SWRCB discussing data collected.

Source: DWR Videos "],["cwq-info.html", "Continuous Water Quality Background", " Continuous Water Quality Background The Continuous Environmental Monitoring Program (CEMP) provides real-time quarter-hourly water quality and environmental data from 15 automated sampling stations in the estuary (Figure 1). The stations provide continuous measurements of 6 water quality parameters and up to 4 environmental parameters at select locations. These measurements are used by operators of the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP) to assess the impacts of the project operations and to adjust project operations to comply with mandated water quality standards. The continuous monitoring program has been in operation since 1983. This report summarizes the results of continuous water quality monitoring at 15 sites for calendar year 2020. The stations are categorized into 5 regions. (Table 1, Figure 2): Northern Interior Delta, Southern Interior Delta, Central Delta, Confluence and Grizzly &amp; Suisun Bays. NOTE: CEMPs Sherman Island station (SSI), which was called D11A in previous reports, has been renamed D22A to better reflect its location in relation to historical station D22.

Each of the 15 monitoring stations collected continuous data for water temperature (WT), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), surface specific conductance (SpC), chlorophyll a fluorescence, and turbidity. Additional sensors were installed at the Antioch, Mallard Island, and Martinez stations in the 1990s to monitor bottom SpC. These measurements, along with river stage data measured at the Mallard Island and Martinez stations, were needed to determine compliance with the salinity standard (also known as X2) that was mandated by the Bay-Delta Plan (SWRCB, 1995). Environmental data, such as air temperature (AT), solar radiation (SRI), wind speed (WV), and wind direction (WD), were measured at all stations as part of D-1641s objectives (SWRCB, 1999). The only environmental parameter analyzed for this report was air temperature from a MET-1 Instrument Mod. 062 sensor. Except for bottom specific conductance, all water samples were collected at 1-m below the water surface using a float-mounted YSI EXO2 multi-parameter water quality sonde. In contrast, bottom specific conductance was measured at 1.5 m above the channel bottom using a YSI EXO1 sonde. Water quality data and environmental data were recorded at 15-minute intervals.

"],["dwq-info.html", "Discrete Water Quality", " Discrete Water Quality Background Water quality is a measure of chemical and physical water conditions relative to the needs for aquatic and human life and is closely linked to the surrounding ecosystem and land use. Aquatic plants require suitable light, nutrients, and water temperatures to survive. Aquatic organisms need dissolved oxygen to breathe, and rely on adequate water temperature, salinity, and pH to survive. Humans need fresh water for recreation, irrigation, as well as to drink. Because of these competing needs, water quality is not easily defined as good or bad, since it depends on who is using it. However, water quality monitoring is a way for scientists to understand the health of our aquatic ecosystem and to help balance the needs of all who use it. Typically, water quality is defined by regulated standards set by a regulatory agency, like the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). If water quality does not meet the regulated standards, then it can be defined as poor. Water quality can be monitored continuously or in a discrete manner, both of which are done by the Environmental Monitoring Program. Discrete water quality monitoring is conducted less frequently than continuous and provides a snapshot into the water conditions at a single moment in time, which is helpful for documenting long-term trends. This type of sampling involves collecting a large quantity of water samples on a monthly basis to be analyzed for numerous water quality tests by a chemical laboratory. The Environmental Monitoring Program monitors 24 fixed discrete water quality stations within the San Francisco Estuary. These stations are sampled monthly at high water slack tide and are primarily accessed by the Research Vessel Sentinel, or by vehicle transport for shore-based stations. Sampling at each of these stations consists of collecting a variety of physical parameters (e.g. water temperature and pH) and grab samples for laboratory analysis (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorous). Analytes EMP collects data for six different field parameters and 18 different laboratory constituents. The analytes highlighted in this report are: Specific Conductance Turbidity Dissolved Ammonia Chlorophyll a Dissolved Nitrate+Nitrite Total Phosphorus Sites To analyze discrete water quality trends, the 24 fixed EMP stations are grouped into six regions of the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary: San Pablo Bay, Suisun and Grizzly Bay, Confluence, Central Delta, Southern Interior Delta, and Northern Interior Delta. Their locations are displayed below. Figure 35: Map of EMPs field sites. "],["dwq-report.html", "Current Report Data and Archived Reports", " Current Report Introduction Water year 2020 was classified as Dry in the Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley, unlike the previous year, which was classified as Wet (source). The 2019-2020 data from all stations within the same region were plotted on one graph and then combined with the graphs from other regions to make a facet graph for each parameter. The minimum and maximum values in 2020 were determined for each field parameter or laboratory analyte to show the range within a single year. The instances when a result fell below the reporting limit were excluded from these minimum and maximum calculations. When this occurred, a vertical dashed line capped at the reporting limit was added to the graph to represent the presence of a non-detect. It should be noted that sampling was not conducted in April, May, and some of December 2020 due to the stay-at-home order and safety concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. *** ### Specific Conductance Surface specific conductance varied greatly in 2020 across the sampling regions with the highest levels occurring in the western regions (San Pablo Bay, Suisun &amp; Grizzly Bays, Confluence) due to the strong marine influence from the Pacific Ocean. Surface specific conductance ranged from an average of 134 µS/cm (C3A in Northern Interior Delta, July) to 45,349 µS/cm (D41 in San Pablo Bay, November) during 2020. Higher specific conductance values were seen in 2020 ( = 11,310 S/cm) than in 2019 ( = 6,702 S/cm), which was likely due to the on-going drought keeping the San Francisco Estuary drier throughout the year. Figure 36: Surface specific conductance in µS/cm at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary during 2019-2020. Turbidity Surface turbidity values ranged from 0.3 FNU (D19 in Central Delta, March) to 41.4 FNU (D7 in Suisun &amp; Grizzly Bays, November) during 2020. The year 2020 had lower average turbidity than in 2019 (9.8 FNU vs. 19.6 FNU), likely due to the drought conditions that result in lack of rainfall and snowpack runoff during the winter months. Figure 37: Surface turbidity in NTU at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary during 2019-2020. Dissolved Ammonia Dissolved ammonia levels in 2020 ranged from  0.05 mg/L (the reporting limit) in several regions to 0.7 mg/L (C3A in Northern Interior Delta, March and June). Dissolved ammonia levels are typically higher at C3A in the Northern Interior Delta due to its location downstream of the effluent discharge from Sacramento Regional Sanitation District. Ammonia levels are typically lower throughout the Delta and Bays, likely due to dilution and nitrification. Figure 38: Dissolved ammonia concentrations in mg/L at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary during 2019-2020. Dashed lines represent the range of possible values for months where the raw value was a non-detect. Chlorophyll a Chlorophyll a values in 2020 ranged from 0.53 µg/L (C3A in the Northern Interior Bay, November and NZ325 in San Pablo Bay, March) to 32.5 µg/L (C10A in Southern Interior Delta, July). The highest levels of chlorophyll a were seen in the Southern Interior Delta region during the summer months in 2020. This was mostly due to elevated levels at station C10A, which is known for being shallow during dry periods of the year, with increased temperatures and lower flows allowing for increased phytoplankton production. These elevated chlorophyll a levels in the summer at C10A also align with the continuous fluorescence data collected at this station. More information about the phytoplankton genera is described in the phytoplankton section. Average chlorophyll levels across all regions were similar in 2020 to those in 2019 (2.84 µg/L vs. 2.28 µg/L). Figure 39: Chlorophyll a concentrations in µg/L at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary during 2019-2020. Dashed lines represent the range of possible values for months where the raw value was a non-detect. Dissolved Nitrate + Nitrite Dissolved nitrate + nitrite values ranged from  0.05 mg/L (the lowest reporting limit) to 3.5 mg/L (P8 in Southern Interior Delta, October) in 2020. The Southern Interior Delta region had the highest fluctuation of dissolved nitrate + nitrite concentrations and had the highest levels compared to the rest of the estuary, likely due to influence from nearby agricultural land use and wastewater treatment effluent. Reporting limits for dissolved nitrate + nitrate were as high as 7.5 and 15 mg/L for western regions in late 2019 due to chloride influence on the analytical method. These reporting limits were cropped out of graphs for scale. Figure 40: Dissolved nitrate and nitrite concentrations in mg/L at six regions in the San Francisco Bay-Delta estuary during 2019-2020. Dashed lines represent the range of possible values for months where the raw value was a non-detect. Total Phosphorus In 2020, total phosphorous levels ranged from 0.04 mg/L (D28A in Central Delta, December) to 0.49 mg/L (P8 in Southern Interior Delta, September). Total phosphorus concentrations were overall similar compared to 2019 (both averaging 0.10 mg/L).

"],["benthic-info.html", "Benthic Invertebrates", " Benthic Invertebrates Background Benthic organisms are creatures that live at the bottom of water bodies. This includes invertebrates (animals without backbones) like clams, shrimp, crabs, worms, aquatic insects, and small crustaceans called amphipods. Some benthic organisms live in or on the soft mud of the San Francisco Estuary, while others attach themselves to rocks and other hard surfaces. There are also benthic vertebrates (animals with backbones) that include various fish species. Benthic organisms are a central part of the estuarine food web, consuming and consumed by other creatures. Every winter during low-tides, thousands of migrating shorebirds feast upon uncovered clams, crabs, and worms found in the mudflats. Humans can also take advantage of the low tides to harvest these organisms. Certain fish species, including juvenile salmon, striped bass, and sturgeon, also consume many types of benthic organisms. A large percentage of the benthic organisms found in the San Francisco Estuary are non-native, and some of these species can have negative effects on the health of the estuary. For example, non-native clams can filter out much of the available phytoplankton, outcompeting the zooplankton who in turn are major sources of fish food. Historically, shrimp supported a large commercial fishery in San Francisco Estuary, and Californias commercial Dungeness crab fishery still depends upon crabs that spend the first two years of their life growing in the San Francisco Estuary. Changes in benthic organisms populations can be indications of larger changes in the physical conditions and water quality of the San Francisco Estuary, including alterations in pollution levels, freshwater inflows, salinity, and sediment composition. Monitoring The Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) has been sampling benthic invertebrates in the San Francisco Estuary since 1975. The benthic monitoring program is one element of DWRs and USBRs Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) conducted under the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) umbrella. The EMP also includes monitoring of water quality, zooplankton and phytoplankton. The overall objective of the benthic monitoring program is to determine the impacts of water project operations on the estuary. These impacts are interpreted by changes in benthic fauna presence, abundance and distribution associated physical factors in the estuary. Data collected from the benthic monitoring program is also used to detect newly introduced species in the estuary. Geographic coverage of the sampling sites ranges from San Pablo Bay east through the upper Estuary to the mouths of the Sacramento, Mokelumne and San Joaquin rivers (see Figure 42). The study area currently comprises ten sites that are sampled monthly. These sites represent a wide variety of habitats that vary in size and physical make-up as well as water quality and sediment composition. The aquatic habitats sampled range from narrow, freshwater channels in the Delta to broad, estuarine bays. The mixing of river water with tidal water creates a wide range of water quality conditions. For example, salinity ranges from freshwater to around 29 ppt in the most western sites. A 0.052 m2 Ponar dredge is used to sample the benthic sediment, and all organisms larger than 0.5 mm are identified and enumerated by taxonomy contractors. To date, 414 species in ten phyla (Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Nemertea, Nematoda, Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Chordata, Phoronida and Echinodermata) have been collected from the study area. Sediment composition data are also collected as part of the benthic monitoring program to document general trends in sediment composition for all sites where benthic samples are collected. Figure 42: Map of EMPs benthic field sites (past and current). "],["benthic-meta.html", "Metadata", " Metadata Period of Record Benthic monitoring began in 1975. From 1975 through 1979 the program collected samples biannually from 18 to 35 stations, for a total of 48 stations over the period. In reviewing data collected between 1975 and 1979, it became evident that semi annual monitoring was insufficient to reveal long term ecological changes as mandated by Water Right Decision 1485. In 1980, DWR revised the benthic monitoring program and began monthly sampling at nine stations. In 1995, major program revisions were implemented to the program. A review of the data collected from 1980 to 1990 recommended that across-channel sampling be reduced to a single station per location in the Delta so that the geographic coverage could be widened. These revisions included increasing the number of sites sampled each month from nine to ten and increasing the number of grab sample replicates from three to four. Detailed information about location, number and characteristics of the historical sites can be found in IEP Technical Report 12 (Markmann, 1986) and IEP Technical Report 38 (Hymanson, et al., 1994). A programmatic review of the EMP in 2001-2002 found that the benthos monitoring element was particularly in need of fundamental and comprehensive consideration through intense special studies and study design examination. Reviewers recommended a temporary reduction in sampling frequency to free up EMP resources to conduct the more spatially intense sampling without requiring additional resources. October 2003 was the last of the monthly sampling events and sampling continued quarterly (in October, January, April, July) at the stations sampled through October 2005 when monthly sampling resumed. Sampling Frequency Biannual sampling was conducted in late spring and fall, from 1975 to 1979. Monthly sampling started in June 1980 and ended in October 2003. Samples were collected quarterly from October 2003 through October 2005. Currently samples are collected monthly. Sample Sites A list of the stations at which benthic invertebrate sampling has occurred is available here. Note: Coordinates are in decimal degrees, and channel position is determined while facing downstream. Field Collection Methods Benthos {.unlisted .unnumbered} All samples are collected using a hydraulic winch and Ponar dredge. The Ponar dredge samples a bottom area of about 0.052 m2 to a depth that varies with the type of sediment and the ability of the dredge to penetrate it. Under the current program four replicate sample grabs are collected at each sampling site. The contents of the dredge are brought to the surface and placed in a large plastic bucket. Water is then added to the sample to create slurry. The contents of each grab sample bucket are washed over Standard No. 30 stainless steel mesh screen (0.595 mm openings). Each sample is carefully washed with a fine spray to remove as much of the substrate as possible. All material remaining on the screen after washing is preserved in a solution of approximately 20% buffered formaldehyde containing Rose Bengal dye for laboratory analysis. The benthic macroinvertebrate sampling methodology used in this program is described in Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, 20th ed. 1998 American Public Health Association, Washington D.C. (See pages 10-60 through 10-74.) | #### Sediment {.unlisted .unnumbered} Sediment samples are also collected as part of the benthic monitoring program. Samples are collected using the same hydraulic winch and Ponar dredge as the infaunal sampling. A single sediment grab is taken at each sampling site. The contents of the Ponar dredge are emptied into a plastic tub and a random subsample is placed into a 1-liter plastic jar for storage and transport to the DWR Soils Laboratory for analysis. Lab Processing Methods Benthos At the laboratory, the volume of settleable substrate in each sample jar is estimated and recorded. The formalin fixative is poured off and the sample is thoroughly washed on a 30-mesh (0.6 mm) screen. The composition of the substrate is estimated and recorded noting the relative percentages of peat, sand, mica, organic detritus, and other materials. The substrate is hand picked for organisms under a three diopter illuminated magnifier. Organisms are placed in 70% ethyl alcohol for subsequent identification. A stereoscopic dissecting microscope (70-120x) is used to identify most organisms. When taxonomic features are too small for identification under the dissecting scope, the organism is permanently mounted on a slide and examined under a compound microscope. If more than four hours of picking is required, and a sample contains many organisms but few species, a one-fourth subsample is chosen at random. The subsample is picked and the results are multiplied by four to represent the total sample. The remainder of the sample is inspected to make sure no other taxa were overlooked. Laboratory identification and enumeration of macro-benthic organisms in each sample is performed under contract by Hydrozoology Laboratory, P.O. Box 682 Newcastle, CA 95658. Analysis has been done by Hydrozoology for the programs entire period of record. Sediment All sediment samples are analyzed by the DWR Soils Laboratory, West Sacramento, CA. Analysis of a sediment sample involves determining the percent size fractions with the use of a mechanical sieve. The sieves sizes are as follow: 75, 37.5, 19, 9.5, 4.75, 2.36, 1.18, 0.6, 0.3, 0.15, 0.075, 0.005, 0.002, 0.001 mm. All particle sizes are found on a regular basis in the samples with the exception of gravel (particles greater than 4.76 mm in diameter). The percent organic content of each sediment sample is also determined from the loss in weight of an oven-dried sample burned at 440 degrees Celsius for 8 hours. All laboratory analysis procedures follow the American Society for Testing Methods, D-2974, Moisture, Ash, and Organic Matterand D-422-63, Particle-Size Analysis of Soil. Works Cited Hymanson, Z., D.

This monitoring is performed by the Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) as part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) and is one component of the biological monitoring mandated by Water Right Decision D-1641. Since benthic species respond to changes in physical factors such as freshwater inflows, salinity, and substrate composition, benthic community data provides an indication of physical changes occurring within the Estuary. Benthic monitoring is an important component of the EMP because operation of the State Water Project can change the Estuarys flow characteristics, affecting the density and distribution of benthic biota. Benthic monitoring data is also used to detect and document the presence of new, non-native species in the Upper Estuary, such as the 1986 arrival and subsequent wide spread of the overbite clam, Potamocorbula amurensis. This article summarizes benthic community characteristics at EMP monitoring sites in 2020 and contextualizes these observations using community data from the preceeding decade. Methods Benthic monitoring was conducted monthly at 10 sampling sites distributed throughout the Estuary, from San Pablo Bay upstream through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Sampling in April, May, and December 2020 was not conducted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. EMP staff collected five bottom grab samples at each station using a Ponar dredge with a sampling area of 0.052 m2. Four replicate grab samples were analyzed for benthic macrofauna and the fifth sample was analyzed for sediment composition. Benthic macrofauna samples were analyzed by Hydrozoology, a private laboratory under contract with DWR. All organisms were identified to the lowest taxon possible and enumerated. Sediment composition analysis was conducted at the DWR Soils and Concrete Laboratory. Field collection methodology and laboratory analysis of benthic macroinvertebrates and sediment composition are described in detail in the benthic metadata found at https://emp-des.github.io/emp-reports/benthic-meta.html Figure 43: Map of EMPs current benthic field sites. Prior to analysis, the units for individual organisms were transformed from count data to densities of individuals per square meter, and the average density was calculated across the four replicate grabs at each site. Species were then grouped by phyla, and time series for each station were constructed to depict seasonal patterns in benthic communities. Rare phyla (&lt; 5% of the total organisms for the given year) were omitted from the plots. We did not report sediment compositions for 2020 because the data for most months was not yet available, due to delays from the COVID-19 pandemic. The 2020 water year was designated as Dry for both the Sacramento Valley and the San Joaquin Valley according to the DWRs Water Year Hydrologic Classification Indices. Benthic communities in 2020 were expected to be like previous Dry and Critically Dry years (most recently during the 2013-2016 drought) and differ from years designated Wet or Above Normal both in species composition and in species abundances. Results The benthic fauna collected in 2020 comprised nine phyla: Mollusca (40% of total organisms), Arthropoda (40%), and Annelida (19%), with Phoronida, Nemotoda, Nemertea, Platyhelminthes, Chordata, and Cnidaria each representing &lt; 1% of total organisms. Of the 180 benthic species collected in 2020, the ten most abundant species represented 83% of all individuals collected throughout the year (Table 1). These include four species of amphipod, two clams, two oligochate worms, and two polychate worms. Only one species in this group (the amphipod Americorophium spinicorne) is known to be native to this estuary; all others are non-native or are cosmopolitan species of unknown origin. Refer to Fields and Messer (1999) for descriptions of the habitat requirements, physical attributes, and feeding methods of many of these species. Figure 44: List of ten most numerous benthic invertebrate species found at EMP sites in 2020. In the site descriptions that follow, most species densities are reported as the annual densities of individuals/m2, sometimes noting dramatic seasonal peaks. Some species, especially arthropods, display strong seasonal variability, with peak monthly densities several times higher than their annual densities. In these cases, we reported the time and magnitude of the peaks as well as the annual densities. Please note, however, that the reported annual densities omit three months of 2020 (April, May, and December) when sampling did not occur, and comparisons to other years annual densities or seasonal patterns should take these omissions into account. Readers who wish to see the full dataset can access it at https://emp.baydeltalive.com/. San Pablo Bay The most saline of our sites, D41 and D41A, are polyhaline sites in San Pablo Bay. At D41 in 2020, the most numerous species was the non-native clam Potamocorbula amurensis, whose density peaked in July to 12,587 individuals per square meter, in a pattern seen primarily in wet years. Site D41 was also notable as the only site where we saw phoronids, also known as horseshoe worms, which are only found in this higher-salinity site. At D41A, there were high densities of the non-native amphipod Ampelisca abdita, which had a high of 9,846 individuals/m2 in December 2020, as well as Potamocorbula amurensis with an average annual density of 1,686 individuals/m2. Figure 45: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D41 in 2020. Figure 46: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D41A in 2020. Suisun and Grizzly Bay In Suisun Bay and Grizzly Bay in 2020, our mesohaline sites D6 and D7 both saw high numbers of the invasive clam P. amurensis, which had an average density of 9,891 individuals/m2 and comprised 97% of all organisms at D6 in 2020, similar to other recent years. At D7, P. amurensis had a September peak of 12,471 individuals/m2, and the non-native amphipod Corophium alienense had a November peak of 10,428 individuals/m2. These two species together made up 94% of all organisms at D7 in 2020. Figure 47: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D6 in 2020. Figure 48: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D7 in 2020. Confluence At the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers, site D4s oligohaline community was comprised in 2020 largely of the amphipods Americorophium spinicorne and Gammarus daiberi, which each had high variability through the year. The oligochaete worm Varichaetadrilus angustipenis also had high density in the second half of the year. Figure 49: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D4 in 2020. Central Delta In the Sacramento River, freshwater site D24 was dominated by the non-native clam Corbicula fluminea, whose numbers averaged 3,016 per square meter over the course of 2020, similar to the very high densities of 2018. There was also a significant seasonal increase in densities of the amphipod Gammarus daiberi between September and December. In the San Joaquin River, freshwater site D16 (at Twitchell Island) was dominated in 2020 by the amphipod Gammarus daiberi, which demonstrated an impressive density peak in May, as well as the clam Corbicula fluminea and the oligochaete worm V. angustipenis. In Old River, freshwater site D28A had a diverse community in 2020. There were high densities of the ostracod crustacean Cyprideis sp. A and the sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa at the beginning of the year and lower densities for most of the rest of 2020. There were also seasonal peaks of the oligochaete worm V. angustipenis and the amphipods G. daiberi and A. spinicorne. Figure 50: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D24 in 2020. Figure 51: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D16 in 2020. Figure 52: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D28A in 2020. Southern Interior Delta Further upstream in the San Joaquin River, site P8 at Buckley Cove was dominated by the sabellid worm M. speciosa which saw peaks in October and March. In addition to this species, which accounted for 59% of all organisms, site P8 saw a diverse community of freshwater oligochaetes, aquatic insects, and amphipods in addition to the non-native clam C. fluminea. At Clifton Court Forebay, freshwater site C9 was dominated by a number of annelid species in 2020. Varichaetadrilus angustipenis, Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri,and Ilyodrilus frantzi were present at high densities throughout the year, at moderately higher levels than in 2018. The amphipod Hyalalla sp. A experienced a dramatic peak in density in November and December. Site C9 is regularly one of our most biodiverse sites, with an additional large number of species present at low densities. Figure 53: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station P8 in 2020. Figure 54: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station C9 in 2020. Summary In summary, 2020 saw an overall decrease in invasive clam density from 2018 (13% for P. amurensis and 10% for C. fluminea). Other notable features of 2020 were the sharp decrease in overall density of the amphipod A. abdita in Grizzly Bay, after reaching a decadal peak in 2018, likely due to 2020s decreased salinity, as well as the 2020 increase in the annelid M. speciosa, after its steady decrease from 2015  2018. Our ability to recognize these changes highlights the importance of monitoring benthic invertebrates to a high taxonomic resolution across the entire estuarine salinity gradient since the community has important interactions with various abiotic conditions as well as key parts of the estuarine food web.

Phytoplankton are small organisms that can be found floating in most water bodies. They occur as unicellular forms (single cell), colonial forms (multiple cells in a clump), filaments (long chains of cells), or flagellates (having flagella that give them some mobility). Like plants, they are primary producers; they convert light energy from the sun and carbon dioxide into the living matter of their cells through photosynthesis. Phytoplankton from the San Francisco Estuary fall into four broad categories: cyanobacteria, diatoms, green algae, and various flagellate groups. Cyanobacteria are the only phytoplankton that are true bacteria, meaning their cells internal structures do not have membranes around them. Often called blue-green algae due to their color, they have colonized nearly all freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats on earth. Some species can produce blooms and harmful toxins that degrade water quality. Diatoms are unique among phytoplankton because they have a cell wall made of glass, or silicon dioxide, called a frustule. They can be unicellular or colonial. There are two main types of diatoms, centric and pennate. Green algae are a large, diverse group of phytoplankton consisting of unicellular, filamentous, colonial, and flagellated forms. They are found in a wide variety of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats. Some species can form nuisance blooms or surface scums in nutrient-rich water. Flagellates include phytoplankton from many different groups, such as cryptophytes, dinoflagellates, chrysophytes, haptophytes, and euglenoids. Some flagellates, like cryptophytes, can be important as food for zooplankton. Some groups of flagellates, such as haptophytes and dinoflagellates, can produce toxic blooms that can kill or poison fish and invertebrates. Why are phytoplankton important? Phytoplankton are the foundation of the aquatic food web. They feed a diverse array of organisms, ranging from microscopic zooplankton to large pelagic fish. Small fish and benthic organisms also graze on phytoplankton, and are in turn consumed by larger organisms such as birds. Because of their importance as the base of the food web, changes in phytoplankton in the San Francisco Estuary can have cascading effects throughout the food web. For example, loss of phytoplankton species that are important food sources can negatively affect the zooplankton and fish species that feed on those phytoplankton, and thus negatively affect the animals preying on those zooplankton and fish. Phytoplankton can also affect elements of water quality such as pH, dissolved oxygen, taste and odor of drinking water, and water transparency. Large algal blooms, both toxic and non-toxic, can have adverse effects on the water quality parameters listed above. They can also have negative aesthetic effects by forming large, floating surface scums. Monitoring changes in phytoplankton can be useful in assessing water quality trends by detecting the presence of nuisance species or the development of large blooms that could require management action. Chlorophyll-a is the primary photosynthetic product made by phytoplankton and plants, and gives them their green color. Chlorophyll-a is also a measure of the biomass that is directly available to organisms that prey on phytoplankton, such as clams and zooplankton. Sometimes the green color is masked by secondary pigments, and these phytoplankton often appear brown or red instead of green. Phytoplankton biomass and the resulting chloro¬phyll-a concentrations in some areas of the Estuary may be influenced by extensive filtration of the water column by the introduced Asian clam, Potamocorbula amurensis. Well-established benthic populations of P. amurensis in Suisun and San Pablo bays are thought to have contrib¬uted to the low chlorophyll-a concentrations (and increased water clarity) measured in these westerly bays since the mid-1980s. By removing phytoplankton from the water, P. amurensis has reduced the amount of phytoplankton available to other organisms such as zooplankton. Department of Water Resources Phytoplankton and Chlorophyll-a Monitoring How is phytoplankton monitored? The California DWR Phytoplankton and Chlorophyll-a monitoring measures the composition (what kinds?), abundance (how many?), diversity (how many kinds?), and distribution (where are they?) of phytoplankton. It also measures phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll-a; both types of monitoring are performed as part of the IEPs Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP). Thirteen fixed sites are currently sampled for both phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a, with two additional sites sampled at variable locations based on bottom specific conductance of 2,000 and 6,000 micro-Siemens, respectively. Historically, samples were collected once or twice monthly at up to 33 sites. Phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a samples are collected monthly alongside the water quality and zooplankton sampling. Whole, unfiltered water samples are collected monthly from one meter below the surface to determine phytoplankton composition; Lugols solution is then added as a stain and preservative. For chlorophyll-a samples, water is filtered onto glass carbon fiber filters for analysis. Phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a data are available from 1975 to the present. Changes in phytoplankton composition, abundance, diversity, distribution, and biomass are monitored throughout the San Francisco Estuary, from San Pablo Bay east through the upper Estuary to the mouths of the Sacramento, Mokelumne, and San Joaquin Rivers. Because different phytoplankton species live in different parts of the Estuary, the sites represent a wide range of habitats of varying physical conditions, including wide ranges of salinity and temperature. Sites range from narrow, freshwater channels in the Delta to broad, estuarine bays. "],["phyto-report.html", "Current Report Contact Info", " Current Report Introduction The Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) are required by Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) to collect phytoplankton and chlorophyll a samples to monitor algal community composition and biomass at select sites in the upper San Francisco Estuary (Estuary). The twenty-four sites range from San Pablo Bay to the inland rivers of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (the Delta). These sites represent a variety of aquatic habitats, from narrow, freshwater channels to broad, estuarine bays. This report describes the results of these monitoring efforts for calendar year 2020. Phytoplankton are small, free-floating organisms that occur as unicellular, colonial, or filamentous forms (Horne and Goldman, 1994). Phytoplankton are a key component of the Estuarys food web, serving as food for zooplankton, invertebrates, and certain fish species. Their metabolic processes also impact water chemistry, and their ability to fix carbon through photosynthesis is one of the key processes influencing water quality in the Estuary. Via this process, phytoplankton can affect the pH, dissolved oxygen, color, taste, and odor of natural waters. Under certain conditions, some species of phytoplankton (e.g., Microcystis aeruginosa) can cause harmful algal blooms (HABs), releasing toxin compounds which can be dangerous or even lethal to animals and humans (Carmichael, 1981). In freshwater, the cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae (class Cyanophyceae), are responsible for producing toxic blooms, particularly in waters that are polluted with phosphates (van den Hoek et al., 1995). Phytoplankton are also useful for assessing water quality (Gannon and Stemberger 1978); their short life cycles allow them to respond quickly to environmental changes, meaning their standing crop and species composition are indicative of source water characteristics (APHA 2012). However, because of their transient nature, patchiness, and free movement in a lotic environment, the utility of phytoplankton as water quality indicators is limited and should be interpreted in conjunction with other biological and physiochemical data (APHA 2012). In addition to collecting phytoplankton samples to assess community composition, we use the measured concentration of chlorophyll a as a proxy to infer phytoplankton biomass. Chlorophyll molecules are complex phytopigments found in most photosynthetic organisms. There are several types of chlorophyll, which are distinguished by slight differences in their molecular structures and constituents. These include chlorophyll a, b, c, and d, with a being the principal photosynthetic pigment in most phytoplankton. This makes the chlorophyll a pigment a reliable proxy measurement for phytoplankton biomass. In addition, we measured the concentration of a different pigment in our water samples, pheophytin a. Pheophytin a is a primary degradation product of chlorophyll a. Comparing its concentration relative to chlorophyll a is a useful metric for estimating the general physiological state of phytoplankton populations. When phytoplankton are actively growing, the concentrations of pheophytin a are normally expected to be low relative to chlorophyll a. Conversely, when the phytoplankton have died and are decaying, levels of pheophytin a are expected to be high in relation to chlorophyll a. Phytoplankton biomass and the resulting amount of chlorophyll a in some areas of the Estuary may be influenced by extensive filtration of the water column by the introduced Asian clam, Potamocorbula amurensis (Alpine and Cloern 1992). Well-established benthic populations of P. amurensis in Suisun and San Pablo bays are thought to have contributed to the low chlorophyll a concentrations (and increased water clarity) measured in these westerly bays since the mid-1980s (Alpine and Cloern 1992). Phytoplankton are small, free-floating organisms that occur as unicellular, colonial, or filamentous forms (Horne and Goldman, 1994). They primarily serve as an important food source for zooplankton, invertebrates, and certain fish species, although they also have a direct effects on water chemistry. Primary production by phytoplankton, primarily via carbon fixation through photosynthesis, is one of the key processes that influence water quality in the Estuary. Via this process, phytoplankton can affect pH, dissolved oxygen, color, taste, and odor. Under certain conditions, some species (eg. Microcystis aeruginosa) can cause harmful algal blooms (HABs), resulting in animal deaths and human illness (Carmichael, 1981). In freshwater, the cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae (class Cyanophyceae), are responsible for producing toxic blooms, particularly in waters that are polluted with phosphates (van den Hoek et al., 1995). Phytoplankton are also useful for assessing water quality (Gannon and Stemberger 1978); their short life cycles allow them to respond quickly to environmental changes, meaning their standing crop and species composition are indicative of source water characteristics (APHA 2012). However, because of their transient nature, patchiness, and free movement in a lotic environment, the utility of phytoplankton as water quality indicators is limited and should be interpreted in conjunction with other biological and physiochemical data (APHA 2012). In addition to collecting phytoplankton samples to assess community composition, we use chlorophyll a concentrations as proxies to calculate phytoplankton biomass. Chlorophylls are complex phytopigment molecules found in all photosynthetic organisms. There are several types of chlorophyll, which are distinguished by slight differences in their molecular structures and constituents. These include chlorophyll a, b, c, and d, with a being the principal photosynthetic pigment in the majority of phytoplankton. This makes the chlorophyll a pigment a reliable proxy measurement for phytoplankton biomass. Furthermore, water samples were analyzed for pheophytin a. Pheophytin a is a primary degradation product of chlorophyll a. Its concentration, relative to chlorophyll a, is useful for estimating the general physiological state of phytoplankton populations. When phytoplankton are actively growing, the concentrations of pheophytin a are normally expected to be low in relation to chlorophyll a. Conversely, when the phytoplankton have died and are decaying, levels of pheophytin a are expected to be high in relation to chlorophyll a. Phytoplankton biomass and the resulting chlorophyll a concentrations in some areas of the Estuary may be influenced by extensive filtration of the water column by the introduced Asian clam, Potamocorbula amurensis (Alpine and Cloern 1992).

Methods Phytoplankton Phytoplankton samples were collected monthly at 24 monitoring sites throughout the Upper Estuary, which were grouped into regions based on their geographic location (Figure 1; Table 1). Samples were collected 1 meter below the waters surface using a submersible pump and stored in 50 mL amber glass bottles. 200 µL of Lugols solution was added to each sample as a stain and preservative. All samples were kept at room temperature and away from direct sunlight until they were analyzed. Phytoplankton identification and enumeration were performed by BSA Environmental, Inc. according to the Utermöhl microscopic method (Utermöhl, 1958) and modified Standard Methods (APHA, 2012). An aliquot of sample was placed into a counting chamber and allowed to settle for a minimum of 12 hours. The aliquot volume, normally 10-20 mL, was adjusted according to the algal population density and the turbidity of the sample. Phytoplankton taxa were enumerated in randomly chosen transects for each settled aliquot. This process was performed at 800x magnification using a Leica DMIL inverted microscope. For each aliquot, a minimum of 400 total algal units were counted, with the dominant taxon accounting for a minimum of 100 algal units. For filamentous or colonial taxa, the number of cells per filament or colony was recorded. Raw organism counts were normalized to the sample volume using the following formula: \\(organisms/mL = {CA_{c} \\over VA_{f}F}\\) where \\(C\\) is the organism count, \\(A_{c}\\) is the area of the cell bottom (mm\\(^2\\)), \\(A_{f}\\) is the area of each grid field (mm\\(^2\\)), \\(F\\) is the number of fields examined, and \\(V\\) is the settled volume (mL). This simplifies to: \\(organisms/mL = {C \\over cV}\\) where \\(cV = {A_{c} \\over VA_{f}F}\\) and is equal to the counted volume. The 10 most common genera were determined by summing the normalized organism counts across all stations and months for each genus. For the bar graphs, average organism counts were calculated per month, per region, and normalized to the number of stations.

Samples were collected by filtering a known volume of water through a glass-fiber filter (1.0 µm pore size) at a pressure of 10 mmHg. For turbid water (&gt; 20 NTU), 200 mL was filtered while 500mL of water was filtered when turbidity was &lt; 20 NTU to prevent clogging. Filters were immediately frozen and transported to DWRs Bryte Laboratory for analysis using spectrophotometry in accordance with the Standard Method 10200 H (APHA, 2012). Samples were processed by mechanically grinding the filter and extracting phytopigments using acetone. Pigment absorption spectra were measured before and after acidification to quantify the amount of chlorophyll a and pheophytin a, respectively. Concentrations were calculated according to a formula specified in the methodology (APHA, 2012). Average analyte concentrations were then calculated per month, per region, and were normalized to the number of stations. Results Phytoplankton Identification All organisms collected in 2020 fell into these ten algal groups:  Pennate diatoms  Centric diatoms  Chrysophytes  Synurophytes  Cyanobacteria  Cryptophytes  Dinoflagellates  Euglenoids  Haptophytes  Green Algae The 10 most common genera collected in 2020 were, in order:  Eucapsis (cyanobacterium)  Chroococcus (cyanobacterium)  Cyclotella (centric diatom)  Chlorella (green alga)  Plagioselmis (cryptophyte flagellate)  Aulacoseira (centric diatom)  Skeletonema (centric diatom)  Cocconeis (pennate diatom)  Nitzschia (pennate diatom)  Pseudanabaena (cyanobacterium) Of the ten groups identified, cyanobacteria constituted the vast majority (98.2%) of the organisms collected (Figure 2). Figure 56: Phytoplankton composition by algal group (other are chrysophytes, ciliates, dinoflagellates, euglenoids, and haptophytes) Pigment Concentrations Some stations showed seasonal patterns in chlorophyll a concentration, while others did not. Most maxima occurred in spring and summer, while minima occurred in fall or winter. Monthly chlorophyll a concentrations throughout much of the estuary were low relative to historic levels. Of the 223 samples taken in 2020, 97.3% (217 samples) had chlorophyll a levels below 10 g/L. Chlorophyll a levels below 10 g/L are considered limiting for zooplankton growth (Müller-Solger et al., 2002). Of the 6 samples with chlorophyll a concentrations equal to or above 10 g/L, five were at C10A (June through October) and one was at P8 in August. The mean chlorophyll a concentration for all samples in 2020 was 2.86 g/L; the median value was 1.88 g/L. Both values are slightly higher than in 2019 (mean = 2.26 g/L, median = 1.67 g/L). The maximum chlorophyll a concentration in 2020 was 32.50 g/L, recorded in July at C10A. This is similar to the 2019 maximum (38.10 g/L). The minimum for 2020 chlorophyll a concentration was 0.53 g/L, recorded at NZ325 in March, and again at C10A in November. It was nearly identical to the 2019 value (0.55 g/L). Eight chlorophyll a samples were below the reporting limit. The mean pheophytin a concentration for all samples in 2020 was 1.65 g/L, slightly higher than the 2019 value (1.41 g/L). The median value was 1.16 g/L, which was also slightly higher than in 2019 (1.02 g/L). The maximum pheophytin a concentration was 11.69 g/L, recorded at NZ032 in August. This value was lower than in 2019 (13.55 g/L). The minimum pheophytin a concentration was 0.50 g/L, which is equivalent to the reporting limit; this was recorded at 2 stations (NZ002 and NZ004) in February. Twenty pheophytin a samples were below the reporting limit; they were observed primarily in the fall/winter. Northern Interior Delta Chlorophyll a average concentrations were higher in early winter, summer, and fall (Figure 3). The highest concentration was recorded at NZ068 in October (2.78 µg/L) and the lowest was recorded at C3A in December (0.53 µg/L), which was one of two recordings of the lowest concentration. The mean and median values were 1.42 g/L and 1.18 g/L, respectively. There were no samples below the detection limit. Pheophytin a average concentrations were highest in the fall; values were similar to chlorophyll a (Figure 3). The maximum (3.20 µg/L) was recorded at NZ068 in September and the minimum (0.52 µg/L) was recorded at C3A in December, although there were four samples below the detection limit (C3A in November, and NZ068 in February, March, and July). The mean and median were 0.98 µg/L and 0.81 µg/L, respectively. Phytoplankton average densities were highest in early winter and early fall, with cyanobacteria dominating throughout the year (Figure 4; other taxa are cryptophytes and dinoflagellates). Pennate diatom density was high in January, and green algae concentrations were relatively high in March and October. Figure 57: Average chlorophyll a and pheophytin a concentrations in the Northern Interior Delta Figure 58: Average organism density in the Northern Interior Delta; other are chrysophytes, cryptophytes, and dinoflagellates Southern Interior Delta Chlorophyll a average concentrations were highest in the summer (Figure 5). The maximum was recorded at C10A in July (32.50 µg/L), which also was the maximum for the year; the minimum was at P8 in January (0.64 µg/L). The mean and median were 5.56 µg/L and 2.98 µg/L, respectively. There were two samples below the detection limit at C9 in December and MD10A in January. Pheophytin a average concentrations were fairly constant throughout the year, with slight spikes in the summer months (Figure 5). The maximum pheophytin a value was recorded at C10A in July (6.06 µg/L); the minimum occurred at P8 in March (0.56 µg/L). The mean and median values were 1.84 µg/L and 1.46 µg/L, respectively. Two samples in January at MD10A and P8 were below the detection limit. Phytoplankton average densities were highest in the summer and fall, with the highest concentrations occurring in July (Figure 6; other taxa are chrysophytes, cryptophytes, euglenoids, and synurophytes). Cyanobacteria dominated throughout the year and centric diatom concentrations were relatively high in the summer months. Figure 59: Average chlorophyll a and pheophytin a concentrations in the Southern Interior Delta Figure 60: Average organism density in the Southern Interior Delta; other are chrysophytes, cryptophytes, and dinoflagellates Central Delta Chlorophyll a average concentrations were highest in the summer and early fall months (Figure 7). The highest chlorophyll a concentration for this region at occurred at D16 in September (8.50 µg/L); the minimum occurred at the same station in January (1.01 µg/L). The mean and median values were 2.63 µg/L and 2.09 µg/L, respectively. There were no samples below the detection limit. Pheophytin a average concentrations were relatively consistent throughout the year excluding a large spike in November (Figure 7), when the highest concentration in the region was recorded (15.40 µg/L, station D19). The minimum occurred at D19 in October (0.50 µg/L). The mean and median values were 1.28 µg/L and 0.90 µg/L, respectively. There was one sample below the detection limit at D16 in January. With the exception of cyanobacteria, phytoplankton average densities were low all year except for a bloom of centric diatoms in August (Figure 8; other taxa are chrysophytes, cryptophytes, and green algae). Figure 61: Average chlorophyll a and pheophytin a concentrations in the Central Delta Figure 62: Average organism density in the Central Delta; other are chrysophytes, cryptophytes, and dinoflagellates Confluence Chlorophyll a average concentrations were highest during early spring and mid-summer (Figure 9). The highest concentration occurred at D12 in August (5.27 µg/L); the minimum was recorded at D22 in November (0.95 µg/L). The mean and median values were 2.53 µg/L and 2.12 µg/L, respectively. There was one sample below the detection limit at D10 in October. Pheophytin a average concentrations were relatively consistent throughout the year except for a peak in September, which was the maximum for the year (Figure 9). The maximum concentration was recorded at D22 in September (5.20 µg/L) and the minimum at the same station in January (0.51 µg/L) (Figure 9). The mean and median for this region were 1.47 µg/L and 1.24 µg/L, respectively. There were two samples below the detection limit at D10 in August and D22 in February. Phytoplankton average densities were higher in winter and early spring; the peak of other taxa in October was mainly cryptophytes and green algae (Figure 10; other taxa are chrysophytes, cryptophytes, euglenoids, and green algae). Cyanobacteria also dominated throughout the year. Figure 63: Average chlorophyll a and pheophytin a concentrations in the Confluence Figure 64: Average organism density in the Confluence; other are chrysophytes, cryptophytes, and dinoflagellates Grizzly Bay and Suisun Bay Chlorophyll a average concentrations in this region was relatively consistent throughout the year (Figure 11). The maximum was recorded at NZS42 in August (9.69 µg/L); the minimum was recorded at D7 in January (0.67 µg/L). The mean and median were 2.71 µg/L and 2.05 µg/L, respectively. There were two samples below the detection limit at D7 in August and NZS42 in September. Pheophytin a average concentrations were relatively consistent throughout the year except for a peak in August, which was the maximum for the year (Figure 11). The maximum concentration was recorded at NZ032 in August (11.69 µg/L) and the minimum at D8 in July (0.56 µg/L). The mean and median were 1.39 µg/L and 1.00 µg/L, respectively. There were two samples below the detection limit at D7 in February and D8 in August. Phytoplankton average densities were relatively higher early in the year, driven mostly by pennate diatoms, centric diatoms, and cyanobacteria (Figure 12; other taxa are cryptophytes, dinoflagellates, euglenoids, green algae, and haptophytes). The peak of other taxa in October was driven mainly by cryptophytes and green algae. Except for cyanobacteria, average densities were low compared to other regions (less than 1000 organisms per milliliter Figure 65: Average chlorophyll a and pheophytin a concentrations in the Grizzly/Suisun Bays Figure 66: Average organism density in the Grizzly/Suisun Bays; other are chrysophytes, cryptophytes, and dinoflagellates San Pablo Bay Chlorophyll a average concentrations were slightly higher in summer and early fall (Figure 13). The maximum was recorded at D41A in September (8.93 µg/L); the minimum concentration was recorded at NZ325 in March, one of two minimums recorded for the year (0.53 µg/L). The mean and median were 2.02 µg/L and 1.71 µg/L, respectively. There were three samples below the detection limit: D6 and NZ325 in August, and NZ002 in November. Pheophytin a average concentrations were lower in the first half of the year, and higher in the second half (Figure 13). The maximum was recorded at D41A in October (7.72 µg/L) and the minimum at both NZ002 and NZ004 in February, which were the lowest values for the year and also the detection limit (0.50 µg/L). The mean and median were 1.76 µg/L and 0.99 µg/L, respectively. There were nine samples below the detection limit: D41, D41A, and NZ325 in January; D41 and NZ325 in February; NZ325 in March; NZ004 in June and July; and NZ325 in October. There were peaks of cyanobacteria in January and October; most of the phytoplankton average densities were lower for the rest of the year (Figure 14; other taxa are cryptophytes, euglenoids, green algae, and haptophytes). The peak of other taxa in June was driven by cryptophytes and green algae.

"],["zoop-info.html", "Zooplankton", " Zooplankton Background Zooplankton are a vital trophic link between aquatic primary producers and higher-level consumers of the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). As primary consumers of phytoplankton, zooplankton facilitate the flow of carbon into a large and complex food web, historically supporting abundant fisheries in the region (Schroeter et al. 2015; Kimmerer et al. 2018). Many fishes, including Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) and Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) feed on zooplankton while rearing in the estuary as larvae and juveniles (Goertler et al. 2018; Heubach et al. 1963), while others like Tule Perch (Hysterocarpus traski) and Prickly Sculpin (Cottus asper) feed on zooplankton throughout their lifetimes (Kimmerer 2006Feyrer et al. 2003)). Zooplankton in the SFE are also a key food source for several endangered and threatened species, notably the Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) (Hobbs et al. 2006; Slater and Baxter 2014). This importance of zooplankton prompted the implementation of the Zooplankton Study in 1972 to assess fish food resources in the upper SFE. Mandated by the State Water Resources Control Boards Water Right Decision D-1641, the study is conducted jointly by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Department of Water Resources under the guidance and management of the Interagency Ecological Program. For nearly 5 decades, this study has monitored the zooplankton community in the region, tracking abundance trends and distributional patterns, detecting and monitoring introduced species, and documenting the dramatic shifts in the communitys composition. Changes in zooplankton abundance and composition have since been linked to major declines of the pelagic fishes in the upper estuary (Sommer et al. 2007; Winder and Jassby 2011). Methods Zooplankton sampling has been conducted since 1974 at least once a month March-November through 1995, monthly from 1995 on. at 20 fixed stations in the upper SFE (Figure 69). Three gear types are used for each sampling event: a pump with a 43-micron mesh net for micro-zooplankton (rotifers, nauplii, and small cyclopoid copepods); a Clarke-Bumpus (CB) net with a 160-micron mesh for sampling meso-zooplankton (cladocera and most juvenile and adult calanoid copepods); and a mysid net with a 505-micron mesh for sampling mysid shrimp and other macro-zooplankton. Both the mysid and CB nets are attached to a sled and towed obliquely from the bottom through the surface for a 10-minute tow. Volume is measured using a General Oceanics flowmeter placed in the mouth of each net so that: V=(end meter-start meter)k*a; where V is the volume of water sampled, k is a flowmeter correction value, and a is the area of the mouth of the net. The Teel Marine 12V utility pump is also used at each station to sample approximately 19.8 gallons from the entire water column, which is filtered through a 43-micron mesh net to concentrate the pump sample. Samples are preserved in 10% formalin with Rose Bengal dye before being processed in the laboratory for identification and enumeration of organisms using a dissecting microscope. More information about the sampling and processing methods can be found in the metadata at here (link currently broken). Abundance indices are calculated for each organism based on the gear type most effective at its capture and reported as the mean catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE). CPUE is calculated as the number of each organism collected per cubic meter of water sampled, so that: CPUE=s*V^(-1); where s is the estimated count of the target organism in the sample. Copepod abundance indices reported here only include adults, as juveniles were not always identified to species. Annual and seasonal abundance indices were calculated using 14 fixed stations sampled consistently since 1974 (Figure 69) and 2 non-fixed stations sampled where bottom specific conductance was roughly 2 and 6 millisiemens per centimeter (approximately 1 and 3 psu). To analyze long-term trends (1974 to present), annual abundance indices were calculated as the mean CPUE for samples collected from March through November, as winter sampling was inconsistent before 1995. Seasonal abundance indices were calculated as the mean CPUE for samples collected during each season: winter (previous December to February), spring (March to May), summer (June to August), and fall (September to November). Long-term seasonal trends for winter are only shown for 1995 to present. Spatial distribution indices for organisms is described as seasonal mean CPUE for by region. Estuary regions were defined as San Pablo Bay (stations D41 and D41A), Suisun Bay (stations D6, 28, 54, and 48), Suisun Marsh (stations 32 and S42), West Delta (stations 60, 64, and 74), Central Delta (stations D16, 86, and D28), and the East Delta (92 and M10). Figure 69: Map of fixed Zooplankton Study stations in the San Francisco Estuary. "],["zoop-report.html", "Current Report Data and Contact Info", " Current Report Introduction This report presents zooplankton annual and seasonal abundance indices and distribution trends from 1974 through 2020 for the most common copepods, cladocera, rotifers, and mysids of the upper estuary. Trends Since the implementation of the Zooplankton Study in 1974, a significant decrease in the overall abundance of zooplankton has been detected in the estuary (Figure 70). Only the abundance of cyclopoid copepods increased in the region during this period, driven by the invasion and spread of Limnoithona tetraspina. The overall decrease in zooplankton abundance in the estuary can be attributed to a series of invasions into the estuary, most notably that of the Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis in the mid-1980s (Kimmerer, Gartside, and Orsi 1994; Carlton et al. 1990). The spread of P. amurensis throughout SFE has had significant impacts on planktonic abundance in the upper estuary due to its high filtration feeding rates on phytoplankton and copepod nauplii. Not only has abundance decreased for most of the zooplankton groups, but dramatic shifts in the composition of these communities have been detected during the study period. These changes have been driven by the introduction and spread of non-native zooplankton species throughout the estuary, compounded with changes to the abiotic and biotic environments. Calanoid copepods While overall calanoid copepod abundance has declined slightly over the study period, community composition has shifted dramatically (Figure 70A). When the study began in the early 1970s the copepods Eurytemora affinis and Acartia spp. dominated the calanoid community. The non-native E. affinis was once the primary prey item of the endangered Delta Smelt, but its abundance has declined to a fraction of what it once was, forcing fish to prey switch to more recently introduced calanoids like Pseudodiaptomus forbesi (Moyle et al. 1992; Slater and Baxter 2014). One of the first recorded introduced calanoid copepods was Sinocalanus doerrii, a freshwater species native to China that invaded the estuary in 1978 and became the most dominant calanoid species in the estuary for a decade (Orsi et al. 1983). Then in 1987, after the invasion of P. amurensis, the calanoid Pseudodiaptomus forbesi was introduced and first detected in the region, competing with the abundant E. affinis (Orsi and Walter 1991). P. forbesi quickly became the numerically dominant calanoid in the upper estuary and remains the most abundant to this day. Another introduction occurred in 1993, when the predatory calanoid copepod Acartiella sinensis quickly became the second most abundant calanoid in the upper estuary, dominating the low-salinity zone in Suisun and the West Delta (Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999). This invasion was hypothesized to have narrowed the range of P. forbesi and calanoid copeopds towards the freshwater zone of the estuary (Figure 71A), as predation on P. forbesi nauplii by A. sinensis has been recorded (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017). In general, calanoid copepod abundance is highest in the estuary during the summer and fall months, with lowest abundances during the winter (Figure 72A). While calanoid copepod abundance peaked in the summer of 2017 at a nearly 20 year high, 2018 through 2020 abundance returned to levels comparable to the previous two decades. In 2020 the distribution of calanoids throughout the estuary was similar to the last two years, with P. forbesi the most abundant in summer and fall in most of the upper estuary (Figure 72A). The predatory Acartiella sinensis was seen in highest densities in the summer and fall mostly in the Suisun Marsh and Suisun Bay regions, similar to 2018 and 2019. In fall 2020, A. sinensis was the most abundant calanoid in Suisun, where it co-occurred with high densities of one of its primary prey items Limnoithona tetraspina (Figure 72B), while P. forbesi was most abundant to the east of Suisun Bay. Acartia spp. was the only native calanoid copepod commonly found in 2020, but it was restricted to Suisun Bay and San Pablo Bay in the lower reaches of the estuary. Eurytemora affinis was most dominant calanoid upriver of Suisun Bay estuary in the spring of 2020, similar to seasonal distribution patterns of the last two decades.

Cyclopoid copepods While overall zooplankton abundance has declined over the study period, the abundance of cyclopoid copepods exploded (Figure 70B). The native Oithona spp. and Acanthocyclops copepods were at low abundances when the study began, but with the introduction of Limnoithona sinensis in the early 1980s, and the later identification of the invasive Limnoithona tetraspina in 1993, cyclopoid indices have increased dramatically(Ferrari and Orsi 1984; Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999) Abundance indices for the two species of Limnoithona were reported together from 1980 through 2006 as Limnoithona spp., then separately since 2007 when they were identified and enumerated as L. sinensis and L. tetraspina. In 2020, L. tetraspina abundance was the highest observed for all copepods (Figure 70B). Much smaller than calanoid copepods collected in the CB net, the Limnoithona cyclopoids are best retained in pump samples, which use aa smaller mesh. Since the early 1990s, Limnoithona spp. abundance has been higher than calanoid copepod abundance, and the small L. tetraspina has become the most common zooplankton in the upper estuary. This increase in L. tetraspina abundance is likely due to a decline of Northern Anchovy in the upper SFE and subsequent decreased predation (Kimmerer 2006), as well as the cyclopoids small size, high growth rate, and motionless behavior, making it very difficult for visual feeders to capture (Bouley and Kimmerer 2006; Greene et al. 2011). These characteristics may increase its ability to escape predation in a region where visual predation is most dominant among fish (Kimmerer 2006). The introduction of L. tetraspin is also linked to the reduction of the range of P. forbesi out of the low-salinity zone of the estuary, as high L. tetraspina densities may have fed and sustained larger populations of the predatory A. sinensis, which also fed on P. forbesi nauplii (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017). Seasonally, Limnoithona tetraspina peaks in summer and fall (Figure 71B), with lower abundance in winter and spring. As in prior years, this cyclopoid was most abundant in the low-salinity zone of the estuary in Suisun Bay and the West Delta (Figure 72B). Oithona davisae, a native cyclopoid, was the most abundant cyclopoid in the higher-salinity San Pablo Bay in summer and fall (Figure 72B). Cladocera The cladoceran community of the upper estuary is composed of Bosmina, Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, and Diaphanosoma species, whose populations have also substantially declined since the onset of the study (Figure 70C). These cladocera tend to be herbivorous, feeding primarily on phytoplankton, and were likely hard hit by the invasion of P. amurensis (Baxter et al. 2008; Kratina and Winder 2015). Cladocerans make up a significant portion in the diets of Delta Smelt, juvenile Chinook Salmon, and young-of-the-year Striped Bass throughout the upper estuary (Heubach et al. 1963; Slater and Baxter 2014; Goertler et al. 2018). The invasion and increase of available copepod prey such as P. forbesi and the decline in cladocera has created a shift in the nutritional content of the plankton community available for fish, with yet to be determined consequences (Kratina and Winder 2015). While Cladocera abundance has declined overall since the study began, recent years abundance has been increased and in 2020 cladocera abundance was the highest observed since 1992 (Figure 71C). In the high outflow year of 2017 some cladocera, namely Bosmina, were found downstream in Suisun and the West Delta, while in 2020 the highest densities of cladocera were found in the East Delta, with trace concentrations found in other regions of the estuary (Figure 72C). Figure 72: Seasonal mean zooplankton CPUE. Spring, summer, and fall are reported for 1974-2018, winter is reported for 1995-2019. A) Calanoid CPUE in the CB net. B) Cyclopoida CPUE in pump samples. C) Cladocera CPUE in the CB net. D) Rotifer CPUE in pump samples. E) Mysid CPUE in the mysid net Rotifer While they are the most abundant zooplankton in the estuary, long-term sampling of rotifers using the pump system shows a dramatic decrease in their annual abundance in the estuary since the beginning of this study (Figure 70D). Several species of rotifers make up the community: most abundant being the Polyarthra, Synchaeta, and Keratella genera. Interestingly, the decline of rotifer abundance beginning in the late 1970s preceded the invasion of P. amurensis in the estuary (Cloern and Jassby 2012). The distribution and abundance of rotifers were similar in 2020 to previous years, with abundances similar to those found since the invasion of P. amurensis. Overall rotifer abundance peaked in the summer and spring (Figure 71D). Keratella and Polyarthra tend to be most abundant in the freshwater and low-salinity zone of the estuary, while Synchaeta species occur most in the higher-salinity areas of San Pablo Bay and Suisun (Figures 3D and 4D)(Winder and Jassby 2011). A spatial and temporal split was discernable between Synchaeta and other rotifers, with Synchaeta having highest densities in the low-salinity zone Bay during the spring, and other rotifers being most abundant in the East Delta in summer. Mysida Not only have mysid abundances declined significantly since the 1970s, but the community has also shifted from being composed almost entirely by the native Neomysis mercedis, to being dominated by the non-native Hyperacanthomysis longirostris (formerly Acanthomysis bowmani) (Figure 70E). The first significant decline in N. mercedis occurred during the 1976-1977 drought, likely caused by food limitation from an absence of diatoms due to very low river discharges (Siegfried et al. 1979; Cloern et al. 1983). The populations of N. mercedis were able to rebound after the years of drought and stayed at high densities in the Suisun Bay region of the upper estuary until the introduction of P. amurensis in the mid-1980s, after which their numbers crashed. In 1993 the introduced H. longirostris was first detected by this study, shortly after the decline of N. mercedis, and it quickly became the most common mysid in the system. However, overall mysid abundances have not returned to their pre-clam invasion levels (Modlin and Orsi 1997, Figure 70E). Mysids have always peaked in the spring and summer months, fluctuating with the higher productivity in the estuary during those seasons (Figure 71E). Historically mysids have been of critical importance in the diets of many fish species in the SFE including Delta Smelt, Longfin Smelt, Striped Bass, and Chinook Salmon (Moyle et al. 1992; Feyrer et al. 2003; CDFG 2009; Goertler et al. 2018). However, the decline of mysids in the upper estuary has resulted in a significant decrease in their presence in the diets of fishes of the region (Feyrer et al. 2003). This general decline in abundance continued in 2019, even though 2016 and 2017 had a modest peak in mysid abundances (Figure 70E), and the distribution and timing of peaks stayed similar over the last two decades (Hennessy 2018). Hyperacanthomysis longirostris was again the most common mysid in the estuary during all seasons, while the once common and native Neomysis mercedis continued to be almost imperceptible in the region. This has been the overall trend in the estuarys mysid communities since 1994. As in prior years, mysids in 2019 were most abundant during the summer and fall (Figure 71E), and highest concentrations occurred in the low-salinity zone of Suisun Bay and Marsh (Figure 72E). Figure 73: Seasonal mean zooplankton CPUE for reporting year by region for A) Calanoid CPUE in the CB net, B) Cyclopoida CPUE in pump samples, C) Cladocera CPUE in the CB net, D) Rotifer CPUE in pump samples, and E) Mysid CPUE in the mysid net. Conclusion In 2019 the Zooplankton Study recorded the abundances of calanoids, cladocera, rotifers, and mysids at lower densities comparable to other recent years and consistent with the downward historic trends in the estuary. Calanoid and cyclopoid copepod abundance peaked in fall, whereas cladocera, rotifers, and mysids peaked in summer. The small, abundant Limnoithona tetraspina was again the most abundant copepod in the upper estuary. This multi-decade zooplankton study has enabled researchers and managers to track the shifts in zooplankton abundances and community composition across the estuary for nearly 5 decades. The Zooplankton Study has documented the introduction and dominance of Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, Limnoithona tetraspina, and Hypercanthomysis longirostris, as well as the communitys response to the invasive clam Potamocorbula amurensis. Understanding these dynamics and how they have fundamentally changed trophic interactions is critical to assessing food resources for fish and conservation strategies in the San Francisco Estuary.

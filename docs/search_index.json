With assistance from the California Department of Water Resources (CDFW), each month EMP scientists visit up to 28 (24 fixed and 4 floating) stations to sample water quality and biological communities (phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates). EMP also services and maintains a network of 15 continuous water quality stations that provide data in real time through the California Data Exchange Network. Since 1975, these efforts have established an irreplaceable ecological record in the San Francisco estuary that has been used in dozens of peer-review scientific articles and technical reports. As a public endeavor, EMP embraces the principles of Open Science and makes the data it collects openly and freely available. This website provides yearly status-and-trends reports on water quality, phytoplankton, zooplankton, and benthic invertebrates while also providing links to Environmental Data Initiative portals where quality-checked versions of EMP’s various datasets are available for download. Program History EMP was formed in response to water quality objectives set by California’s State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) to protect beneficial uses of water in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, Suisun, and San Pablo Bays. The data collected and analyzed by EMP scientists is essential for the effective management of water resources in the estuary and assures that the objectives mandated by SWRCB in the permits issued to DWR and UBSR are met. The standards include minimum Delta outflows, limits to Delta water export by the State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP), and maximum allowable salinity levels in the Delta. The regulatory basis for what became EMP began in 1971 when the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) established new water quality requirements for the San Francisco Bay-Delta Estuary in Water Right Decision 1379 (D-1379). This decision provided the terms and conditions for a comprehensive monitoring program to evaluate changes in environmental conditions within the estuary. A monitoring program was first implemented in 1971 following the design laid out by the Stanford Research Institute (SWRCB Publication 40). These water quality standards were amended in 1978 (D-1485) and again in 1999 (D-1641). The SWP and CVP are currently operated to comply with the requirements of the latter. The annual reports displayed on this website constitute the annual reports submitted to SWRCB by DWR and USBR in fulfillment of the D-1641 reporting requirement.

"],["00-dwq-info.html", "Discrete Water Quality", " Discrete Water Quality Background Water quality is a measure of chemical and physical water conditions relative to the needs for aquatic and human life and is closely linked to the surrounding ecosystem and land use. Aquatic plants require suitable light, nutrients, and water temperatures to survive. Aquatic organisms need dissolved oxygen to breathe, and rely on adequate water temperature, salinity, and pH to survive. Humans need fresh water for recreation, irrigation, as well as to drink. Because of these competing needs, water quality is not easily defined as “good” or “bad,” since it depends on who is using it. However, water quality monitoring is a way for scientists to understand the health of our aquatic ecosystem and to help balance the needs of all who use it. Typically, water quality is defined by regulated standards set by a regulatory agency, like the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB). If water quality does not meet the regulated standards, then it can be defined as poor. Water quality can be monitored continuously or in a discrete manner, both of which are done by the Environmental Monitoring Program. Discrete water quality monitoring is conducted less frequently than continuous and provides a snapshot into the water conditions at a single moment in time, which is helpful for documenting long-term trends. This type of sampling involves collecting a large quantity of water samples on a monthly basis to be analyzed for numerous water quality tests by a chemical laboratory. The Environmental Monitoring Program monitors 24 fixed discrete water quality stations within the San Francisco Estuary. These stations are sampled monthly at high water slack tide and are primarily accessed by the Research Vessel Sentinel, or by vehicle transport for shore-based stations. Sampling at each of these stations consists of collecting a variety of physical parameters (e.g. water temperature and pH) and grab samples for laboratory analysis (e.g. nitrogen and phosphorous).

"],["00-benthic-info.html", "Benthic Invertebrates", " Benthic Invertebrates Background Benthic organisms are creatures that live at the bottom of water bodies. This includes invertebrates (animals without backbones) like clams, shrimp, crabs, worms, aquatic insects, and small crustaceans called amphipods. Some benthic organisms live in or on the soft mud of the San Francisco Estuary, while others attach themselves to rocks and other hard surfaces. There are also benthic vertebrates (animals with backbones) that include various fish species. Benthic organisms are a central part of the estuarine food web, consuming and consumed by other creatures. Every winter during low-tides, thousands of migrating shorebirds feast upon uncovered clams, crabs, and worms found in the mudflats. Humans can also take advantage of the low tides to harvest these organisms. Certain fish species, including juvenile salmon, striped bass, and sturgeon, also consume many types of benthic organisms. A large percentage of the benthic organisms found in the San Francisco Estuary are non-native, and some of these species can have negative effects on the health of the estuary. For example, non-native clams can filter out much of the available phytoplankton, outcompeting the zooplankton who in turn are major sources of fish food. Historically, shrimp supported a large commercial fishery in San Francisco Estuary, and California’s commercial Dungeness crab fishery still depends upon crabs that spend the first two years of their life growing in the San Francisco Estuary. Changes in benthic organisms’ populations can be indications of larger changes in the physical conditions and water quality of the San Francisco Estuary, including alterations in pollution levels, freshwater inflows, salinity, and sediment composition. Monitoring The Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) has been sampling benthic invertebrates in the San Francisco Estuary since 1975. The benthic monitoring program is one element of DWR’s and USBR’s Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) conducted under the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) umbrella. The EMP also includes monitoring of water quality, zooplankton and phytoplankton. The overall objective of the benthic monitoring program is to determine the impacts of water project operations on the estuary. These impacts are interpreted by changes in benthic fauna presence, abundance and distribution associated physical factors in the estuary. Data collected from the benthic monitoring program is also used to detect newly introduced species in the estuary. Geographic coverage of the sampling sites ranges from San Pablo Bay east through the upper Estuary to the mouths of the Sacramento, Mokelumne and San Joaquin rivers (see Figure 42). The study area currently comprises ten sites that are sampled monthly. These sites represent a wide variety of habitats that vary in size and physical make-up as well as water quality and sediment composition. The aquatic habitats sampled range from narrow, freshwater channels in the Delta to broad, estuarine bays. The mixing of river water with tidal water creates a wide range of water quality conditions. For example, salinity ranges from freshwater to around 29 ppt in the most western sites. A 0.052 m2 Ponar dredge is used to sample the benthic sediment, and all organisms larger than 0.5 mm are identified and enumerated by taxonomy contractors. To date, 414 species in ten phyla (Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, Nemertea, Nematoda, Annelida, Arthropoda, Mollusca, Chordata, Phoronida and Echinodermata) have been collected from the study area. Sediment composition data are also collected as part of the benthic monitoring program to document general trends in sediment composition for all sites where benthic samples are collected. Figure 1: Map of EMP’s benthic field sites (past and current). "],["00-benthic-report.html", "Current Report Archived Reports", " Current Report Introduction Benthic monitoring conducted by the California Department of Water Resources (DWR) since 1975 has documented changes in the composition, density, and distribution of the macrobenthic biota inhabiting the upper San Francisco Estuary. This monitoring is performed by the Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP) as part of the Interagency Ecological Program (IEP) and is one component of the biological monitoring mandated by Water Right Decision D-1641. Since benthic species respond to changes in physical factors such as freshwater inflows, salinity, and substrate composition, benthic community data provides an indication of physical changes occurring within the Estuary. Benthic monitoring is an important component of the EMP because operation of the State Water Project can change the Estuary’s flow characteristics, affecting the density and distribution of benthic biota. Benthic monitoring data is also used to detect and document the presence of new, non-native species in the Upper Estuary, such as the 1986 arrival and subsequent wide spread of the overbite clam, Potamocorbula amurensis. This report summarizes benthic community characteristics at EMP monitoring sites in 2022 and contextualizes these observations using community data from the preceding decade. Methods Benthic monitoring was conducted monthly at 10 sampling sites distributed throughout the Estuary, from San Pablo Bay upstream through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (Figure 41). EMP staff collected four bottom grab samples at each station using a Ponar dredge with a sampling area of 0.052 m2. The four replicate grab samples were analyzed for benthic macrofauna by Hydrozoology, a private laboratory under contract with DWR. All organisms were identified to the lowest taxon possible and enumerated. For more in-depth methodology, see here. Figure 1: Map of EMP’s current benthic field sites. Results The benthic fauna collected in 2022 comprised nine phyla: Annelida (42% of total organisms), Arthropoda (28%) and Mollusca (30%), with Phoronida, Nematoda, Chordata, Platyhelminthes, Cnidaria, and Nemertea each representing1% or less of total organisms. Of the 200 benthic species collected in 2022, the ten most abundant species represented 70% of all individuals collected throughout the year (Table 1). These include three species of amphipod, two clams, two oligochate worms, two polychate worms, and one cumacean arthropod (also known as a comma shrimp, although it is not actually a shrimp). Only one species in this group (the amphipod Americorophium spinicorne) is native to this estuary. The rest of the top ten species are non-native or are cosmopolitan species of unknown origin. Refer to Fields and Messer (1999) for descriptions of the habitat requirements, physical attributes, and feeding methods of many of these species. Figure 2: List of ten most numerous benthic invertebrate species found at EMP sites in 2022. In the site descriptions that follow, most species densities are reported as the annual densities of individuals/m2, sometimes noting dramatic seasonal peaks. Some species, especially arthropods, display strong seasonal variability with peak monthly densities several times higher than their annual densities. In these cases, we reported the time and magnitude of the peaks as well as the annual densities. Please note that the station P8 was not sampled in December 2022 due to heavy fog, and comparisons to other years’ average annual densities or seasonal patterns should take this omission into account. Readers who wish to see the full dataset and its associated metadata can access here. North Delta (D24) Site D24 is located on the Sacramento River, just south of the Rio Vista Bridge (Figure 41). There were 19 species in six phyla at D24. Mollusca was the most abundant phylum for much of the year and made up 83% of all organisms collected at the station (Figure 43). A large majority (80%) of the individual organisms found at D24 in 2021 were the non-native clam Corbicula fluminea, with an annual average density of 1,595 individuals/m2. Corbicula fluminea density in 2022 was a decline from the high densities of 2018-2020, which peaked with 2020’s annual average of 3,756 individuals/m2. The second most abundant organism was the non-native amphipod Gammarus daiberi with an annual density of 230 individuals/m2, which was a similar decline from a 2020 peak of 1,078 individuals/m2. Besides these notable declines from 2020 peaks, the composition of the community at D24 in 2022 was similar to other years in the last decade. Figure 3: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D24 in 2022. Figure 4: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D24 in 2022. Central Delta (D16, D28A) The benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations, in the Central Delta, D16 and D28. Site D16 is on the lower San Joaquin River near Twitchell Island (Figure 41). There were 19 species in three phyla at D16 in 2022, split largely between Arthropoda (48% of all organisms collected in 2020), Mollusca (36%), and Annelida (16%), (Figure 44). The most abundant species at D16 was the clam Corbicula fluminea which accounted for 33% of all organisms in 2022, with an average annual density of 93 individuals/m2 and a peak in March of 308 individuals/m2. The amphipod Americorophium spinicorne was the second most abundant organism, accounting for 32% of all individuals, with an average annual density of 92 individuals/m2 and a drastic peak in February of 1034 individuals/m2. Much of the rest of the community was a combination of multiple species of amphipods and other annelid worms at lower densities. The total number of organisms at D16 in 2022 was slightly increased from the very low numbers of 2020 and 2021, but was still lower than other years in the previous decade In particular, 2020-2022 saw very low numbers of the amphipod Americorophium spinicorne, which has vwwn seen in very high numbers from 2015-2018. The site on Old River near Rancho Del Rio is known as D28A (Figure 41). In 2022, there were 70 species in seven phyla at D28A, and this site had the largest number of individual organisms collected. The most abundant phylum was Annelida, followed by Arthropoda and Mollusca (61%, 34%, and 4% of all organisms, respectively) (Figure 45). The most abundant species was the sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa with an annual density of 1,726 individuals/m2 and a notable peak in March of 4,577 individuals/m2. Next most abundant was the oligochaete worm Variachaetadrilus angustipenis, with an annual density of 1,609 individuals/m2, followed by the amphipods Gammarus daiberi and Americorophium spinicorne, with annual densities of 1,044 and 903 individuals/m2. Both these amphipod species had marked peaks in June and July, with low densities the rest of the year. Site D28A had annual total densities of organisms that were comparable to other years in the past decade, and also similarly high species richness. Figure 5: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D16 in 2022. Figure 6: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D28A in 2022. South Delta (P8, C9) The benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations in the South Delta. Site P8 is on the San Joaquin River at Buckley Cove (Figure 41). Station P8 had a total of 64 species in six phyla in 2022. Annelida was by far the most abundant phyla at this station in 2022, accounting for 86% of all organisms collected (Figure 46). The dominant species driving most of the Annelida patterns was the non-native sabellid worm Manayunkia speciosa, which had an annual density of 2,594 individuals/m2 and accounted by itself for 42% of all organisms. Manayunkia speciosa in 2022 remained moderately higher than its lowest densities in 2018 and 2020, but nowhere near the high densities seen from 2012 to 2015 which peaked at 11,338 individuals/m2 in 2015. The oligochate worms Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Varichaetadrilus angustipenis were the next most common organisms at 1,514 and 505 individuals/m2 annual density, followed by a long tail of many species represented at low densities. This community composition has remained largely unchanged through the last decade, apart from the notable boom and bust of M. speciosa. Site C9 is on Old River at the Clifton Court Forebay intake (Figure 41). There were 87 species in seven phyla at C9 in 2022, a tie with 2021’s record high for site species richness. Annelida was the dominant phylum throughout the year, accounting for 69% of all organisms collected in 2020, followed by 25% Arthropoda. (Figure 47). An oligochaete worm, Varichaetadrilus angustipenis, made up 28% of all organisms with an annual density of 1,316 individuals/m2, which was less than half its density in 2021 and roughly a third of the high-density years of 2012, 2013, and 2019; it reached similar lows in the drought years of 2015 and 2016. The freshwater amphipod Hyalella sp. A ranked second with an annual average of 740 individuals/m2, most of which were seen in a peak of 3,129 individuals/m2 in November. Like V. angustipenis, Hyalella had very low annual densities in 2022, and these have declined steadily since 2012. The oligochaete worms Limnodrilus hoffmeisteri and Ilyodrilus frantzi complete the list of higher-density organisms, at 621 and 502 individuals/m2. Similar to P8, C9 has a large number of low-density species, including the highest diversity of aquatic insect larvae at any site sampled (27 species in 2022, mostly chironomid midges). The community was dominated by oligochates and had the same overal composition as it has for many years, but 2022 saw a notably lower average CPUE than at any time in the last decade. Figure 7: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station P8 in 2022. Figure 8: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station C9 in 2022. Confluence (D4) Site D4 is located near the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, just north of Point Sacramento (Figure 41). There were 41 species in four phyla at D4 in 2022, and the second largest numbrr of total organisms in 2022. Arthropoda was the most abundant phylum (51% of all organisms) followed by Annelida (25% of all organisms) and Mollusca (24% of all organisms) (Figure 48). The native amphipod Americorophium spinicorne was the most abundant species at this station, and made up slightly over 35% of all individual organisms in 2022 with a dramatic seasonal peak of 23,8052 individuals/m2 in May 2022 but an annual average considerably lower than any year since 2016. The invasive bivalve Potamocorbula amurensis was second, with an annual average density of 1,296 individuals/m2, up moderately from the low densities of the preceding decade. The annelid Laonome calida came next with an annual density of 1,093 individuals/m2. Because of D4’s position at the front of saltwater and freshwater mixing in the estuary, we often see a shift from the freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea to more brackish-water Potamocorbula amurensis in dry years, and indeed the recent high densities of Corbicula from 2017 through 2019 continued to decline while Potamocorbula increased over the same time period. 2022 was also notable for its continued decrease in A. spinicorne in 2022 from the peaks in 2019 and 2020. Like C9, D4 in 2022 had the lowest overall lower average density of total organism it has seen in a decade. Figure 9: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D4 in 2022. Suisun Bay (D6 and D7) The benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations in the Suisun Bay area, D6 and D7. Site D6 is in Suisun Bay near the I-680 bridge (Figure 41) and had 28 species in five phyla in 2022. Mollusca was the dominant phylum, accounting for 91% of all organisms collected (Figure 49). Most of the organisms collected were the invasive Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis, which had an annual density of 4,600 individuals/m2, in a considerable decrease from its 2020 high of 22,708 individuals/m2. Potamocorbula amurensis was most abundant in from June through October. The relatively few other organisms found at this site were predominately from phylum Arthropoda (mostly the brackish-water bay barnacle Amphibalanus improvisus, found mostly growing on P. amurensis shells). 2022 saw the lowest number of P. amurensis in over a decade at D6. Site D7 is in Grizzly Bay, near the entrance to Suisun Slough (Figure 41). There were 30 species in five phyla in 2022. Arthropoda comprised 49% of the total organisms, Mollusca 43%, and Annelida 8%. The cumacean arthropod Nippoleucon hinumensis and the non-native clam Potamocorbula amurensis were the two most abundant species, comprising 44% and 43% of the total community through the year, respectively (Figure 50). For the first time since the invasion of P. amurensis, there were fewer P. amurensis than N. hinumensis in 2022 at D7. Nippoleucon hinumensis had an annual density of 2,298 organisms/m2, but saw a strong seasonal pattern: relatively high densities from March through June and relatively lower densities the rest of the year. Potamocorbula amurensis had an annual average density of 2,241/organisms/m2. While P. amurensis has been numerically dominant through the last decade, a major change in 2022 was the rise of N. hinumensis and a simultaneous crash of the amphipod Sinocorophium alienense, which had been the second-densest species at D7 for at least the last decade. Sinocorophium alienense crashed in 2021 to around 300 organisms/m2, and was completely absent from D7 in 2022. Figure 10: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D6 in 2022. Figure 11: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D7 in 2022. San Pablo Bay (D41, D41A) The benthic monitoring program sampled at two stations in San Pablo Bay, D41 and D41A. Station D41 is near Point Pinole (Figure 41) and has a benthic community primarily comprised of marine organisms, especially in drier water years. There were 77 species in eight phyla at D41 in 2022. Arthropoda was the most abundant phylum (41% of all organisms) followed by Annelida (35%), Mollusca (11%) and Phoronida (11%) (Figure 51). The dominance of phylum Arthropoda was due almost entirely to the non-native amphipod Ampelisa abdita, and this one species comprised 38% of all organisms found at this station in 2021, with an annual average of 1,450 individuals/m2. Ampelisca abdita was most abundant from in June and July, peaking at 9,264 individuals/m2 in July and decreasing for much of the rest of the year. The second most abundant species was Phoronis harmeri, a native tube-dwelling filter-feeder, from the small marine lopophorate phylum Phoronida with had an average annual density of 415 individuals/m2 . The window shell clam Theora lubrica, along with the tube-dwelling spionid worm Pseudopolydora kempi and the polychaete worm Scoletoma luti, were the other species found in notable densities. D41 overall community composition in 2021 was similar to the preceding decade, and adds another year of evidence supporting the observation that higher-salinity years such as 2021 see density increases in more marine species such as Apelisca abdita, Phoronis harmeri, and Theora lubrica but lower numbers of the clam Potamocorbula amurensis, which prefers more brackish water and is mostly only seen at D41 in wetter water years. Station D41A is in San Pablo Bay near the mouth of the Petaluma River (Figure 41). There were 51 species in seven phyla at D41A in 2021. The most abundant phyla was Annelida (60% of all organisms), with Mollusca second (27%) and Arthropoda third (11%) (Figure 52). The two most numerous species were the window shell clam Theora lubrica and the spionid worm Pseudopolydora paucibranchia, which together made up 48% of all organisms in roughly equal numbers. The sabellid worm Euchone limnicola was third with 16% of the total organisms. All three of these species had summer peaks, with their highest densities in June and July. Theora lubrica peaked in July 2,072 individuals/m2, P. paucibranchia in July at 4,529 individuals/m2, and E. limnicola in June at 1,966 individuals/m2. The community in 2022 was lacking the species which had been numerically dominant for the previous decade: the amphipods Ampelisca abdita and Monocorophim acherusicum, the clam Potamocorbula amurensis, and the small cumacean arthropod Nippoleucon hinumensis were at some of their lowest levels since 2012. Figure 12: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D41 in 2022. Figure 13: Density of benthic organisms, by month, collected at station D41A in 2022. Conclusion In summary, 2022 saw lower average organism density than any year of the past decade. This trend was consistent across most sites but was largely caused by decrease of previously high densities of Potamocorbula amurensis at stations D6 and D7, and various amphipod species at many other sites, especially Ampelisca abdita in San Pablo Bay and Sinocorophium alienense in Grizzly Bay. The freshwater clam Corbicula fluminea is also at low average densities in most upstream sites, along with the cumacean arthropod Nippoleucon himumensis in the Grizzly Bay, Suisun Bay, and Confluence stations. Since many fish species have switched to amphipod food sources after the collapse of mysid shrimps (Feyrer et al. 2003), the near disappearance of various amphipod and cumacean species may may have food web implications unless they have simply shifted its range out of our sampling area. Ordinarily, the decrease of both species of invasive clams and their filter-feeding activity would be a favorable sign for the ecosystem, and maybe their lower numbers in 2022 will be beneficial later on in 2023 if they allow other species to rebound, but the relative absence of several other numerically dominant members of the community in 2022 has unclear implications. Our ability to recognize these changes over decadal timescales highlights the importance of continued monitoring of benthic invertebrates to a high taxonomic resolution across the entire estuarine salinity gradient, as the community interacts with both various abiotic conditions as well as key parts of the estuarine food web.

Phytoplankton are small organisms that can be found floating in most water bodies. They occur as unicellular forms (single cell), colonial forms (multiple cells in a clump), filaments (long chains of cells), or flagellates (having flagella that give them some mobility). Like plants, they are primary producers; they convert light energy from the sun and carbon dioxide into the living matter of their cells through photosynthesis. Phytoplankton from the San Francisco Estuary fall into four broad categories: cyanobacteria, diatoms, green algae, and various flagellate groups. Cyanobacteria are the only phytoplankton that are true bacteria, meaning their cells’ internal structures do not have membranes around them. Often called blue-green algae due to their color, they have colonized nearly all freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats on earth. Some species can produce blooms and harmful toxins that degrade water quality. Diatoms are unique among phytoplankton because they have a cell wall made of glass, or silicon dioxide, called a frustule. They can be unicellular or colonial. There are two main types of diatoms, centric and pennate. Green algae are a large, diverse group of phytoplankton consisting of unicellular, filamentous, colonial, and flagellated forms. They are found in a wide variety of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats. Some species can form nuisance blooms or surface scums in nutrient-rich water. Flagellates include phytoplankton from many different groups, such as cryptophytes, dinoflagellates, chrysophytes, haptophytes, and euglenoids. Some flagellates, like cryptophytes, can be important as food for zooplankton. Some groups of flagellates, such as haptophytes and dinoflagellates, can produce toxic blooms that can kill or poison fish and invertebrates. Why are phytoplankton important? Phytoplankton are the foundation of the aquatic food web. They feed a diverse array of organisms, ranging from microscopic zooplankton to large pelagic fish. Small fish and benthic organisms also graze on phytoplankton, and are in turn consumed by larger organisms such as birds. Because of their importance as the base of the food web, changes in phytoplankton in the San Francisco Estuary can have cascading effects throughout the food web. For example, loss of phytoplankton species that are important food sources can negatively affect the zooplankton and fish species that feed on those phytoplankton, and thus negatively affect the animals preying on those zooplankton and fish. Phytoplankton can also affect elements of water quality such as pH, dissolved oxygen, taste and odor of drinking water, and water transparency. Large algal blooms, both toxic and non-toxic, can have adverse effects on the water quality parameters listed above. They can also have negative aesthetic effects by forming large, floating surface scums. Monitoring changes in phytoplankton can be useful in assessing water quality trends by detecting the presence of nuisance species or the development of large blooms that could require management action. Chlorophyll-a is the primary photosynthetic product made by phytoplankton and plants, and gives them their green color. Chlorophyll-a is also a measure of the biomass that is directly available to organisms that prey on phytoplankton, such as clams and zooplankton. Sometimes the green color is masked by secondary pigments, and these phytoplankton often appear brown or red instead of green. Phytoplankton biomass and the resulting chloro¬phyll-a concentrations in some areas of the Estuary may be influenced by extensive filtration of the water column by the introduced Asian clam, Potamocorbula amurensis. Well-established benthic populations of P. amurensis in Suisun and San Pablo bays are thought to have contrib¬uted to the low chlorophyll-a concentrations (and increased water clarity) measured in these westerly bays since the mid-1980s. By removing phytoplankton from the water, P. amurensis has reduced the amount of phytoplankton available to other organisms such as zooplankton. How is phytoplankton monitored? The California DWR Phytoplankton and Chlorophyll-a monitoring measures the composition (what kinds?), abundance (how many?), diversity (how many kinds?), and distribution (where are they?) of phytoplankton. It also measures phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll-a; both types of monitoring are performed as part of the IEP’s Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP). Thirteen fixed sites are currently sampled for both phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a, with two additional sites sampled at variable locations based on bottom specific conductance of 2,000 and 6,000 micro-Siemens, respectively. Historically, samples were collected once or twice monthly at up to 33 sites. Phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a samples are collected monthly alongside the water quality and zooplankton sampling. Whole, unfiltered water samples are collected monthly from one meter below the surface to determine phytoplankton composition; Lugol’s solution is then added as a stain and preservative. For chlorophyll-a samples, water is filtered onto glass carbon fiber filters for analysis. Phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a data are available from 1975 to the present. Changes in phytoplankton composition, abundance, diversity, distribution, and biomass are monitored throughout the San Francisco Estuary, from San Pablo Bay east through the upper Estuary to the mouths of the Sacramento, Mokelumne, and San Joaquin Rivers. Because different phytoplankton species live in different parts of the Estuary, the sites represent a wide range of habitats of varying physical conditions, including wide ranges of salinity and temperature. Sites range from narrow, freshwater channels in the Delta to broad, estuarine bays. "],["00-phyto-report.html", "Current Report Archived Reports", " Current Report Introduction The Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) are required by Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) to collect phytoplankton and chlorophyll a samples to monitor algal community composition and biomass at select sites in the upper San Francisco Estuary (Estuary). This report describes the results of these monitoring efforts for water year 2022, which was classified as a critical year in the Sacramento Valley (source). Methods Samples were collected monthly at 24 monitoring sites throughout the Upper Estuary and were grouped into regions based on their geographic location (Figure 1; Table 1). These sites represent a variety of aquatic habitats, from narrow, freshwater channels to broad, estuarine bays.

For the bar graphs, average organism counts were calculated per month, per region, and normalized to the number of stations. Average summary statistics are reported as the mean (μ) ± the standard deviation. For more in-depth methodology, see here. Chlorophyll a and Pheophytin a Samples of chlorophyll a and pheophytin a were collected monthly at 24 monitoring sites throughout the upper Estuary using a submersible pump positioned 1 meter below the water’s surface. Average analyte concentrations were then calculated per month, per region, and were normalized to the number of stations. Average summary statistics are reported as the median (M) ± the median absolute deviation. For more in-depth methodology, see here. Overall Results Phytoplankton Identification All organisms collected in 2022 fell into these 10 algal groups: • Chrysophytes• Cryptophytes• Cyanobacteria• Diatoms (Pennate and Centric)• Dinoflagellates• Euglenoids• Green Algae• Haptophytes• Raphidophytes The 10 most common genera collected in 2022 were, in order:• Eucapsis (cyanobacteria)• Cyclotella (centric diatoms)• Plagioselmis (cryptophytes)• Nitzschia (pennate diatoms)• Chlorella (green algae)• Cocconeis (cyanobacteria)• Teleaulax (centric diatoms)• Cryptomonas (cryptophytes)• Monoraphidium (pennate diatoms)• Navicula (green algae) Of the 10 groups identified, cryptophytes, cyanobacteria, diatoms, and green algae constituted the vast majority (97.7%) of the organisms collected. Figure 2: Phytoplankton composition by algal group Pigment Concentrations 97.9% of samples had chlorophyll a levels below 10 μg/L. Chlorophyll a levels below 10 μg/L are considered limiting for zooplankton growth (Müller-Solger et al., 2002). Of the 7 samples with chlorophyll a concentrations equal to or above 10 μg/L, one occurred at NZ325 in April; three occurred in August (NZ002, NZ004, and NZ325); one occurred at NZ325 in February; one occurred at D10 in March; and one occurred at D41A in May. The average chlorophyll a concentration was 2.08 ± x μg/L; this is lower than the critical year average (M = 2.37 ± x μg/L). Values ranged from &lt; 0.5 μg/L (the reporting limit) to 49.8 μg/L (NZ325 in August). 8 samples were below the reporting limit. The average pheophytin concentration was 2.08 ± x μg/L; this is lower than the critical year average (M = 2.37 ± x μg/L).

"],["00-zoop-info.html", "Zooplankton", " Zooplankton Background Zooplankton are a vital trophic link between aquatic primary producers and higher-level consumers of the San Francisco Estuary (SFE). As primary consumers of phytoplankton, zooplankton facilitate the flow of carbon into a large and complex food web, historically supporting abundant fisheries in the region (Schroeter et al. 2015; Kimmerer et al. 2018). Many fishes, including Striped Bass (Morone saxatilis) and Chinook Salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) feed on zooplankton while rearing in the estuary as larvae and juveniles (Goertler et al. 2018; Heubach et al. 1963), while others like Tule Perch (Hysterocarpus traski) and Prickly Sculpin (Cottus asper) feed on zooplankton throughout their lifetimes (Kimmerer 2006, Feyrer et al. 2003). Zooplankton in the SFE are also a key food source for several endangered and threatened species, notably the Delta Smelt (Hypomesus transpacificus) and Longfin Smelt (Spirinchus thaleichthys) (Hobbs et al. 2006; Slater and Baxter 2014). This importance of zooplankton prompted the implementation of the Zooplankton Study in 1972 to assess fish food resources in the upper SFE. Mandated by the State Water Resources Control Board’s Water Right Decision D-1641, the study is conducted jointly by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife and the California Department of Water Resources under the guidance and management of the Interagency Ecological Program. For nearly 5 decades, this study has monitored the zooplankton community in the region, tracking abundance trends and distributional patterns, detecting and monitoring introduced species, and documenting the dramatic shifts in the community’s composition. Changes in zooplankton abundance and composition have since been linked to major declines of the pelagic fishes in the upper estuary (Sommer et al. 2007; Winder and Jassby 2011). Methods Zooplankton sampling has been conducted since 1974 at least once a month March-November through 1995, and monthly from 1995 through the present, at 20 fixed stations in the upper SFE (Figure 69). Three gear types are used for each sampling event: a pump with a 43-micron mesh net for micro-zooplankton (rotifers, nauplii, and small cyclopoid copepods); a Clarke-Bumpus (CB) net with a 160-micron mesh for sampling meso-zooplankton (cladocera and most juvenile and adult calanoid copepods); and a mysid net with a 505-micron mesh for sampling mysid shrimp and other macro-zooplankton. Both the mysid and CB nets are attached to a sled and towed obliquely from the bottom through the surface for a 10-minute tow. Volume is measured using a General Oceanics flowmeter placed in the mouth of each net so that: \\(V = (end meter - startmeter)k*a\\) where \\(V\\) is the volume of water sampled (mL), \\(k\\) is a flow meter collection value, and \\(a\\) is the area of the mouth of the net (mm\\(^2\\)). The Teel Marine 12V utility pump is also used at each station to sample approximately 19.8 gallons from the entire water column, which is filtered through a 43-micron mesh net to concentrate the pump sample. Samples are preserved in 10% formalin with Rose Bengal dye before being processed in the laboratory for identification and enumeration of organisms using a dissecting microscope. More information about the sampling and processing methods can be found in the metadata at here. Abundance indices are calculated for each organism based on the gear type most effective at its capture and reported as the mean catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE). CPUE is calculated as the number of each organism collected per cubic meter of water sampled, so that: Volume is measured using a General Oceanics flowmeter placed in the mouth of each net so that: \\(CPUE=s*V^{-1}\\) where \\(s\\) is the estimated count of the target organism in the sample. Copepod abundance indices reported here only include adults, as juveniles were not always identified to species. Annual and seasonal abundance indices were calculated using 14 fixed stations sampled consistently since 1974 (Figure 67) and 2 non-fixed stations sampled where bottom specific conductance was roughly 2 and 6 millisiemens per centimeter (approximately 1 and 3 psu). To analyze long-term trends (1974 to present), annual abundance indices were calculated as the mean CPUE for samples collected from March through November, as winter sampling was inconsistent before 1995. Seasonal abundance indices were calculated as the mean CPUE for samples collected during each season: winter (previous December to February), spring (March to May), summer (June to August), and fall (September to November). Long-term seasonal trends for winter are only shown for 1995 to present. Spatial distribution indices for organisms is described as seasonal mean CPUE for by region. Estuary regions were defined as San Pablo Bay (stations D41 and D41A), Suisun Bay (stations D6, 28, 54, and 48), Suisun Marsh (stations 32 and S42), West Delta (stations 60, 64, and 74), Central Delta (stations D16, 86, and D28), and the East Delta (92 and M10).

The 2022 EMP Zooplankton Report will be updated shortly. Introduction This report presents zooplankton annual and seasonal abundance indices and distribution trends from 1974 through 2021 for the most common copepods, cladocera, rotifers, and mysids of the upper estuary. Trends Since the implementation of the Zooplankton Study in 1974, a significant decrease in the overall abundance of zooplankton has been detected in the estuary (Figure 68). Only the abundance of cyclopoid copepods increased in the region during this period, driven by the invasion and spread of Limnoithona tetraspina. The overall decrease in zooplankton abundance in the estuary can be attributed to a series of invasions into the estuary, most notably that of the Asian clam Potamocorbula amurensis in the mid-1980s (Kimmerer, Gartside, and Orsi 1994; Carlton et al. 1990). The spread of P. amurensis throughout SFE has had significant impacts on planktonic abundance in the upper estuary due to its high filtration feeding rates on phytoplankton and copepod nauplii. Not only has abundance decreased for most of the zooplankton groups, but dramatic shifts in the composition of these communities have been detected during the study period. These changes have been driven by the introduction and spread of non-native zooplankton species throughout the estuary, compounded with changes to the abiotic and biotic environments. Calanoid copepods While overall calanoid copepod abundance has declined slightly over the study period, community composition has shifted dramatically (Figure 68A). When the study began in the early 1970s the copepods Eurytemora affinis and Acartia spp. dominated the calanoid community. The non-native E. affinis was once the primary prey item of the endangered Delta Smelt, but its abundance has declined to a fraction of what it once was, forcing fish to prey switch to more recently introduced calanoids like Pseudodiaptomus forbesi (Moyle et al. 1992; Slater and Baxter 2014). One of the first recorded introduced calanoid copepods was Sinocalanus doerrii, a freshwater species native to China that invaded the estuary in 1978 and became the most dominant calanoid species in the estuary for a decade (Orsi et al. 1983). Then in 1987, after the invasion of P. amurensis, the calanoid Pseudodiaptomus forbesi was introduced and first detected in the region, competing with the abundant E. affinis (Orsi and Walter 1991). P. forbesi quickly became the numerically dominant calanoid in the upper estuary and remains the most abundant to this day. Another introduction occurred in 1993, when the predatory calanoid copepod Acartiella sinensis quickly became the second most abundant calanoid in the upper estuary, dominating the low-salinity zone in Suisun and the West Delta (Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999). This invasion was hypothesized to have narrowed the range of P. forbesi and calanoid copeopds towards the freshwater zone of the estuary (Figure 69A), as predation on P. forbesi nauplii by A. sinensis has been recorded (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017). In general, calanoid copepod abundance is highest in the estuary during the summer and fall months, with lowest abundances during the winter (Figure 70A). While calanoid copepod abundance peaked in the summer of 2017 at a 20 year high, 2018 through 2021 abundance returned to levels comparable to the previous two decades. In 2021 the distribution of calanoids throughout the estuary was similar to the last two years, with P. forbesi the most abundant in summer and fall in most of the upper estuary (Figure 70A). The predatory Acartiella sinensis was seen in highest densities in the summer and fall mostly in the West Delta, with lower abundances in the Suisun Bay and Suisun Marsh regions compared to 2020. In the summer and fall of 2021, A. sinensis was the most abundant calanoid in Suisun and the West Delta, where it co-occurred with high densities of one of its primary prey item Limnoithona tetraspina (Figure 70B), while P. forbesi was most abundant in the Central and East Delta. The shift of density for P. forbesi upstream out of Suisun Marsh could be due to the ongoing drought conditions in the estuary. Acartia spp. was the only native calanoid copepod commonly found in 2021, but it was restricted to Suisun Bay and San Pablo Bay in the lower reaches of the estuary. Eurytemora affinis was most dominant calanoid in the estuary in the spring of 2021, similar to seasonal distribution patterns of the last two decades.

Cyclopoid copepods While overall zooplankton abundance has declined over the study period, the abundance of cyclopoid copepods has exploded (Figure 68B). The native Oithona spp. and Acanthocyclops copepods were at low abundances when the study began, but with the introduction of Limnoithona sinensis in the early 1980s, and the later identification of the invasive Limnoithona tetraspina in 1993, cyclopoid indices have increased dramatically (Ferrari and Orsi 1984; Orsi and Ohtsuka 1999). Abundance indices for the two species of Limnoithona were reported together from 1980 through 2006 as Limnoithona spp., then separately since 2007 when they were identified and enumerated as L. sinensis and L. tetraspina. For the sake of consistency, both have been summed as Limnoithona spp. in figures for this report. In 2021, Limnoithona spp. abundance was the highest observed for all zooplankton (Figure 68B). Much smaller than calanoid copepods collected in the CB net, the Limnoithona cyclopoids are best retained in pump samples, which use a smaller mesh. Since the early 1990s, Limnoithona spp. abundance has been higher than calanoid copepod abundance, and the small L. tetraspina has become the most common zooplankton in the upper estuary. This increase in L. tetraspina abundance is likely due to a decline of Northern Anchovy in the upper SFE and subsequent decreased predation (Kimmerer 2006), as well as the cyclopoid’s small size, high growth rate, and motionless behavior, making it very difficult for visual feeders to capture (Bouley and Kimmerer 2006; Greene et al. 2011). These characteristics may increase its ability to escape predation in a region where visual predation is most dominant among fish (Kimmerer 2006). The introduction of L. tetraspina is also linked to the reduction of the range of P. forbesi out of the low-salinity zone of the estuary, as high L. tetraspina densities may have fed and sustained larger populations of the predatory A. sinensis, which also feed on P. forbesi nauplii (Kayfetz and Kimmerer 2017). Seasonally, Limnoithona tetraspina peaks in summer and fall (Figure 69B), with lower abundance in winter and spring. As in prior years, these cyclopoids were most abundant in the low-salinity zone of the estuary in Suisun Bay and the West Delta (Figure 70B). Oithona davisae, a native cyclopoid, was the most abundant cyclopoid in the higher-salinity San Pablo Bay in summer and fall (Figure 70B). Cladocera The cladoceran community of the upper estuary is composed of Bosmina, Daphnia, Ceriodaphnia, and Diaphanosoma species, whose populations have also substantially declined since the onset of the study (Figure 68C). These cladocera tend to be herbivorous, feeding primarily on phytoplankton, and were likely hard hit by the invasion of P. amurensis (Baxter et al. 2008; Kratina and Winder 2015). Cladocerans make up a significant portion in the diets of Delta Smelt, juvenile Chinook Salmon, and young-of-the-year Striped Bass throughout the upper estuary (Heubach et al. 1963; Slater and Baxter 2014; Goertler et al. 2018). The invasion and increase of available copepod prey such as P. forbesi and the decline in cladocera has created a shift in the nutritional content of the plankton community available for fish, with yet to be determined consequences (Kratina and Winder 2015). While Cladocera abundance has declined overall since the study began, recent years abundance has been increasing above the lowest levels found in the 1990s (Figure 69C). In the high outflow year of 2017 some cladocera, namely Bosmina, were found downstream in Suisun and the West Delta, but in 2021 the highest densities of cladocera were found in the East Delta, with trace concentrations found in other regions of the estuary (Figure 70C).

C) Cladocera CPUE in the CB net. D) Rotifer CPUE in pump samples. E) Mysid CPUE in the mysid net Rotifer While they are the most abundant zooplankton in the estuary, long-term sampling of rotifers shows a dramatic decrease in their annual abundance in the estuary since the beginning of this study (Figure 68D). Several species of rotifers make up the community: most abundant being the Polyarthra, Synchaeta, and Keratella genera. Interestingly, the decline of rotifer abundance beginning in the late 1970s preceded the invasion of P. amurensis in the estuary (Cloern and Jassby 2012). The distribution and abundance of rotifers were similar in 2021 to previous years, with abundances similar to those found since the invasion of P. amurensis. Overall rotifer abundance peaked in the summer and spring (Figure 69D). Keratella and Polyarthra tend to be most abundant in the freshwater and low-salinity zone of the estuary, while Synchaeta species are most abundant in the higher-salinity areas of San Pablo Bay and Suisun (Winder and Jassby 2011). A spatial and temporal split was discernible between Synchaeta and other rotifers, with Synchaeta having highest densities in the low-salinity zone Bay during the spring, and other rotifers being most abundant in the East Delta in summer. Mysida Not only have mysid abundances declined significantly since the 1970s, but the community has also shifted from being composed almost entirely by the native Neomysis mercedis, to being dominated by the non-native Hyperacanthomysis longirostris (formerly Acanthomysis bowmani) (Figure 68E). The first significant decline in N. mercedis occurred during the 1976-1977 drought, likely caused by food limitation from an absence of diatoms due to very low river discharges (Siegfried et al. 1979; Cloern et al. 1983). The populations of N. mercedis were able to rebound after the years of drought and stayed at high densities in the Suisun Bay region of the upper estuary until the introduction of P. amurensis in the mid-1980s, after which their numbers crashed. In 1993 the introduced H. longirostris was first detected by this study, shortly after the decline of N. mercedis, and it quickly became the most common mysid in the system. However, overall mysid abundances have not returned to their pre-clam invasion levels (Modlin and Orsi 1997, Figure 68E). Mysids have always peaked in the spring and summer months, fluctuating with the higher productivity in the estuary during those seasons (Figure 69E). Historically mysids have been of critical importance in the diets of many fish species in the SFE including Delta Smelt, Longfin Smelt, Striped Bass, and Chinook Salmon (Moyle et al. 1992; Feyrer et al. 2003; CDFG 2009; Goertler et al. 2018). However, the decline of mysids in the upper estuary has resulted in a significant decrease in their presence in the diets of fishes of the region (Feyrer et al. 2003). These low abundances have continued, even though 2021 saw a slight increase in overall mysid abundance compared to the previous few years (Figure 68E), and the distribution and timing of peaks stayed similar over the last two decades (Hennessy 2018). Hyperacanthomysis longirostris was again the most common mysid in the estuary during all seasons, while the once common and native Neomysis mercedis continued to be almost imperceptible in the region. This has been the overall trend in the estuary’s mysid communities since 1994. As in prior years, mysids in 2021 were most abundant during the summer and fall (Figure 69E), and highest concentrations occurred in the low-salinity zone of Suisun and the West Delta (Figure 70E). Seasonal mean zooplankton CPUE for reporting year by region for A) Calanoid CPUE in the CB net, B) Cyclopoida CPUE in pump samples, C) Cladocera CPUE in the CB net, D) Rotifer CPUE in pump samples, and E) Mysid CPUE in the mysid net. Conclusion In 2021 the Zooplankton Study recorded the abundances of calanoids, cladocera, rotifers, and mysids at lower densities comparable to other recent years and consistent with the downward historic trends in the estuary. Abundances for all zooplankton peaked in summer for 2021. The small, abundant Limnoithona tetraspina was again the most abundant copepod in the upper estuary, and has also become the most abundance zooplankton in the upper estuary. This multi-decade zooplankton study has enabled researchers and managers to track the shifts in zooplankton abundances and community composition across the estuary for nearly 5 decades. The Zooplankton Study has documented the introduction and dominance of Pseudodiaptomus forbesi, Limnoithona tetraspina, and Hypercanthomysis longirostris, as well as the community’s response to the invasive clam Potamocorbula amurensis. Understanding these dynamics and how they have fundamentally changed trophic interactions is critical to assessing food resources for fish and conservation strategies in the San Francisco Estuary.

"],["00-veliger.html", "Veliger Monitoring Program Background Sampling Protocols Contact Info", " Veliger Monitoring Program Background The Zebra/Quagga Mussel Veliger Monitoring Program monitors zebra (Dreissena polymorpha) and quagga (Dreissena bugensis) mussel abundance within the Delta. These species were first discovered in Lakes St. Clair and Erie in 1988 and have since expanded their geographic distribution into many other freshwater systems in North America. These mussels were introduced into the Great Lakes by means of discharged ballast water from transoceanic ships that may have contained mussel larvae or possibly juveniles. While zebra and quagga mussels have not been detected in or near the California Delta, the Department of Water Resources’ Zebra and Quagga Mussel Early Detection Monitoring Program aims to monitor the potential spread of zebra and quagga mussels in California waterways. The first stage of the mussel lifecycle is called a veliger, which is a free-swimming planktonic larva that develops miniature bivalve shells and feeds by utilizing its hair-like cilia. Veligers drift with the currents and eventually settle onto hard substrates using sticky secretions. Once settled, they are considered juveniles that eventually develop to sexual maturity, becoming adult mussels after about a year of growth. Zebra and quagga mussels have negative impacts on aquatic food webs by filtering increased amounts of phytoplankton, which then creates a food source deficiency for organisms in higher trophic levels. They also excrete unwanted particulate matter (pseudofeces) that undergoes decomposition, which causes oxygen levels to decrease and toxic byproducts (ammonia and hydrogen sulfide) to be released into the water. Zebra and quagga mussels also influence industrial processes by colonizing hard surfaces, placing potential limitations on pumping plants for water distribution. This program sets out to monitor any traces of zebra and quagga mussel veliger DNA throughout the California water system to prevent the negative effects associated with the spread of these introduced mussels. Map of veliger monitoring stations for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region. Sampling Protocols While this program includes many other regions and sampling methods, the map and sampling protocols listed here are specific to the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta region. Sampling for this region takes place once a month at each of the three monitoring stations displayed on the map. At each station, a 45-meter horizontal surface tow is conducted using a 64-micron mesh plankton net. The material collected at the cod end of the net is that of which cannot pass through the 64-micron mesh. These particulates are rinsed into a sample container and submitted to a laboratory for PCR analysis, which determines presence/absence of zebra/quagga mussel veliger DNA. In order to sample all three stations in one day, some nets require decontamination in the field prior to reuse. This decontamination process consists of soaking each net in vinegar for a minimum of one hour and then spraying all surfaces of the net with a 10% bleach solution.

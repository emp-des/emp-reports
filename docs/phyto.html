<h4>What are Phytoplankton?<a href="phyto.html#what-are-phytoplankton" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p><b>Phytoplankton</b> are small organisms that can be found floating in most water bodies. They occur as unicellular forms (single cell), colonial forms (multiple cells in a clump), filaments (long chains of cells), or flagellates (having flagella that give them some mobility). Like plants, they are primary producers; they convert light energy from the sun and carbon dioxide into the living matter of their cells through photosynthesis. Phytoplankton from the San Francisco Estuary fall into four broad categories: cyanobacteria, diatoms, green algae, and various flagellate groups.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cyanobacteria</b> are the only phytoplankton that are true bacteria, meaning their cells’ internal structures do not have membranes around them. Often called blue-green algae due to their color, they have colonized nearly all freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats on earth. Some species can produce blooms and harmful toxins that degrade water quality.</li>
<li><b>Diatoms</b> are unique among phytoplankton because they have a cell wall made of glass, or silicon dioxide, called a frustule. They can be unicellular or colonial. There are two main types of diatoms, centric and pennate.</li>
<li><b>Green algae</b> are a large, diverse group of phytoplankton consisting of unicellular, filamentous, colonial, and flagellated forms. They are found in a wide variety of freshwater, marine, and terrestrial habitats. Some species can form nuisance blooms or surface scums in nutrient-rich water.</li>
<li><b>Flagellates</b> include phytoplankton from many different groups, such as cryptophytes, dinoflagellates, chrysophytes, haptophytes, and euglenoids. Some flagellates, like cryptophytes, can be important as food for zooplankton. Some groups of flagellates, such as haptophytes and dinoflagellates, can produce toxic blooms that can kill or poison fish and invertebrates.</li>
</ul>

<div id="why-are-phytoplankton-important" class="section level4 unlisted unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h4>Why are phytoplankton important?<a href="phyto.html#why-are-phytoplankton-important" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>Phytoplankton are the foundation of the aquatic food web. They feed a diverse array of organisms, ranging from microscopic zooplankton to large pelagic fish. Small fish and benthic organisms also graze on phytoplankton, and are in turn consumed by larger organisms such as birds. Because of their importance as the base of the food web, changes in phytoplankton in the San Francisco Estuary can have cascading effects throughout the food web. For example, loss of phytoplankton species that are important food sources can negatively affect the zooplankton and fish species that feed on those phytoplankton, and thus negatively affect the animals preying on those zooplankton and fish.</p>
<p>Phytoplankton can also affect elements of water quality such as pH, dissolved oxygen, taste and odor of drinking water, and water transparency. Large algal blooms, both toxic and non-toxic, can have adverse effects on the water quality parameters listed above. They can also have negative aesthetic effects by forming large, floating surface scums. Monitoring changes in phytoplankton can be useful in assessing water quality trends by detecting the presence of nuisance species or the development of large blooms that could require management action.</p>
<p><b>Chlorophyll-a</b> is the primary photosynthetic product made by phytoplankton and plants, and gives them their green color. Chlorophyll-a is also a measure of the biomass that is directly available to organisms that prey on phytoplankton, such as clams and zooplankton.<br />
Sometimes the green color is masked by secondary pigments, and these phytoplankton often appear brown or red instead of green. Phytoplankton biomass and the resulting chloro¬phyll-a concentrations in some areas of the Estuary may be influenced by extensive filtration of the water column by the introduced Asian clam, Potamocorbula amurensis. Well-established benthic populations of P. amurensis in Suisun and San Pablo bays are thought to have contrib¬uted to the low chlorophyll-a concentrations (and increased water clarity) measured in these westerly bays since the mid-1980s. By removing phytoplankton from the water, P. amurensis has reduced the amount of phytoplankton available to other organisms such as zooplankton.</p>

<h4>How is phytoplankton monitored?<a href="phyto.html#how-is-phytoplankton-monitored" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h4>
<p>The California DWR Phytoplankton and Chlorophyll-a monitoring measures the composition (what kinds?), abundance (how many?), diversity (how many kinds?), and distribution (where are they?) of phytoplankton. It also measures phytoplankton biomass as chlorophyll-a; both types of monitoring are performed as part of the IEP’s Environmental Monitoring Program (EMP). Thirteen fixed sites are currently sampled for both phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a, with two additional sites sampled at variable locations based on bottom specific conductance of 2,000 and 6,000 micro-Siemens, respectively. Historically, samples were collected once or twice monthly at up to 33 sites. Phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a samples are collected monthly alongside the water quality and zooplankton sampling.
Whole, unfiltered water samples are collected monthly from one meter below the surface to determine phytoplankton composition; Lugol’s solution is then added as a stain and preservative. For chlorophyll-a samples, water is filtered onto glass carbon fiber filters for analysis. Phytoplankton and chlorophyll-a data are available from 1975 to the present.</p>
<p>Changes in phytoplankton composition, abundance, diversity, distribution, and biomass are monitored throughout the San Francisco Estuary, from San Pablo Bay east through the upper Estuary to the mouths of the Sacramento, Mokelumne, and San Joaquin Rivers.</p>
<p>Because different phytoplankton species live in different parts of the Estuary, the sites represent a wide range of habitats of varying physical conditions, including wide ranges of salinity and temperature. Sites range from narrow, freshwater channels in the Delta to broad, estuarine bays.</p>

<p>The Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) are required by Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) to collect phytoplankton and chlorophyll a samples to monitor algal community composition and biomass at select sites in the upper San Francisco Estuary (Estuary). The twenty-four sites range from San Pablo Bay to the inland rivers of the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta (“the Delta”). These sites represent a variety of aquatic habitats, from narrow, freshwater channels to broad, estuarine bays. This report describes the results of these monitoring efforts for calendar year 2021.</p>
<p>Phytoplankton are small, free-floating organisms that occur as unicellular, colonial, or filamentous forms (Horne and Goldman, 1994). Phytoplankton are a key component of the Estuary’s food web, serving as food for zooplankton, invertebrates, and certain fish species. Their metabolic processes also impact water chemistry, and their ability to fix carbon through photosynthesis is one of the key processes influencing water quality in the Estuary. Via this process, phytoplankton can affect the pH, dissolved oxygen, color, taste, and odor of natural waters.</p>
<p>Under certain conditions, some species of phytoplankton (e.g., Microcystis aeruginosa) can cause harmful algal blooms (HABs), releasing toxin compounds which can be dangerous or even lethal to animals and humans (Carmichael, 1981). In freshwater, the cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae (class Cyanophyceae), are responsible for producing toxic blooms, particularly in waters that are polluted with phosphates (van den Hoek et al., 1995). Phytoplankton are also useful for assessing water quality (Gannon and Stemberger 1978); their short life cycles allow them to respond quickly to environmental changes, meaning their standing crop and species composition are indicative of source water characteristics (APHA 2012). However, because of their transient nature, patchiness, and free movement in a lotic environment, the utility of phytoplankton as water quality indicators is limited and should be interpreted in conjunction with other biological and physiochemical data (APHA 2012).</p>
<p>In addition to collecting phytoplankton samples to assess community composition, we use the measured concentration of chlorophyll a as a proxy to infer phytoplankton biomass. Chlorophyll molecules are complex phytopigments found in most photosynthetic organisms. There are several types of chlorophyll, which are distinguished by slight differences in their molecular structures and constituents. These include chlorophyll a, b, c, and d, with a being the principal photosynthetic pigment in most phytoplankton. This makes the chlorophyll a pigment a reliable proxy measurement for phytoplankton biomass.</p>
<p>In addition, we measured the concentration of a different pigment in our water samples, pheophytin a. Pheophytin a is a primary degradation product of chlorophyll a. Comparing its concentration relative to chlorophyll a is a useful metric for estimating the general physiological state of phytoplankton populations. When phytoplankton are actively growing, the concentrations of pheophytin a are normally expected to be low relative to chlorophyll a. Conversely, when the phytoplankton have died and are decaying, levels of pheophytin a are expected to be high in relation to chlorophyll a.</p>
<p>Phytoplankton biomass and the resulting amount of chlorophyll a in some areas of the Estuary may be influenced by extensive filtration of the water column by the introduced Asian clam, Potamocorbula amurensis (Alpine and Cloern 1992). Well-established benthic populations of P. amurensis in Suisun and San Pablo bays are thought to have contributed to the low chlorophyll a concentrations (and increased water clarity) measured in these westerly bays since the mid-1980s (Alpine and Cloern 1992).</p>
<p>Primary production by phytoplankton, primarily via carbon fixation through photosynthesis, is one of the key processes that influence water quality in the Estuary. Via this process, phytoplankton can affect pH, dissolved oxygen, color, taste, and odor. Under certain conditions, some species (eg. Microcystis aeruginosa) can cause harmful algal blooms (HABs), resulting in animal deaths and human illness (Carmichael, 1981). In freshwater, the cyanobacteria, or blue-green algae (class Cyanophyceae), are responsible for producing toxic blooms, particularly in waters that are polluted with phosphates (van den Hoek et al., 1995). Phytoplankton are also useful for assessing water quality (Gannon and Stemberger 1978); their short life cycles allow them to respond quickly to environmental changes, meaning their standing crop and species composition are indicative of source water characteristics (APHA 2012). However, because of their transient nature, patchiness, and free movement in a lotic environment, the utility of phytoplankton as water quality indicators is limited and should be interpreted in conjunction with other biological and physiochemical data (APHA 2012).</p>

<p>Phytoplankton samples were collected monthly at 24 monitoring sites throughout the Upper Estuary, which were grouped into regions based on their geographic location (Figure 1; Table 1). Sampling occurred from March through December; sampling for January and February were cancelled because of the COVID pandemic. Samples were collected 1 meter below the water’s surface using a submersible pump and stored in 50 mL amber glass bottles. 200 µL of Lugol’s solution was added to each sample as a stain and preservative. All samples were kept at room temperature and away from direct sunlight until they were analyzed.</p>
Phytoplankton identification and enumeration were performed by BSA Environmental, Inc. according to the Utermöhl microscopic method (Utermöhl, 1958) and modified Standard Methods (APHA, 2012). An aliquot of sample was placed into a counting chamber and allowed to settle for a minimum of 12 hours. The aliquot volume, normally 10-20 mL, was adjusted according to the algal population density and the turbidity of the sample. Phytoplankton taxa were enumerated in randomly chosen transects for each settled aliquot. This process was performed at 800x magnification using a Leica DMIL inverted microscope. For each aliquot, a minimum of 400 total algal units were counted, with the dominant taxon accounting for a minimum of 100 algal units. For filamentous or colonial taxa, the number of cells per filament or colony was recorded.
<!-- This section writes out the formula to convert raw organism counts. If the text needs to be modified, let Sarah know. -->
<!-- The text is: Raw organism counts were normalized to the sample volume using the following formula: organisms/mL=C/(VA_f F) where C is the organism count, A_c is the area of the cell bottom (mm2), A_f is the area of each grid field (mm2), F is the number of fields examined, and V is the settled volume (mL). This simplifies to: organisms/mL=C/cV where cV=A_c/VA_f F and is equal to the counted volume. -->

<p>Samples of chlorophyll a and pheophytin a were collected monthly at 24 monitoring sites throughout the upper Estuary using a submersible pump positioned 1 meter below the water’s surface. Sampling occurred from March through December; sampling for January and February were cancelled because of the COVID pandemic. Samples were collected by filtering a known volume of water through a glass-fiber filter (1.0 µm pore size) at a pressure of 10 mmHg. For turbid water (&gt; 20 NTU), 200 mL was filtered while 500mL of water was filtered when turbidity was &lt; 20 NTU to prevent clogging.</p>
<p>Filters were immediately frozen and transported to DWR’s Bryte Laboratory for analysis using spectrophotometry in accordance with the Standard Method 10200 H (APHA, 2012). Samples were processed by mechanically grinding the filter and extracting phytopigments using acetone. Pigment absorption spectra were measured before and after acidification to quantify the amount of chlorophyll a and pheophytin a, respectively. Concentrations were calculated according to a formula specified in the methodology (APHA, 2012). Average analyte concentrations were then calculated per month, per region, and were normalized to the number of stations.</p>

<p>Some stations showed seasonal patterns in chlorophyll a concentration, while others did not. Most maxima occurred in spring and summer, while minima occurred in fall or winter. Monthly chlorophyll a concentrations throughout much of the estuary were low relative to historic levels. Of the 240 samples taken in 2021, 96.7% (232 samples) had chlorophyll a levels below 10 μg/L. Chlorophyll a levels below 10 μg/L are considered limiting for zooplankton growth (Müller-Solger et al., 2002). Of the 8 samples with chlorophyll a concentrations equal to or above 10 μg/L, one occurred at C10A in March; three occurred in April (C10A, D22,and NZS42); one occurred in June (D41A); and three occurred in August (D19, D26, and D28A).</p>
<p>The mean chlorophyll a concentration for all samples in 2021 was 3.37 μg/L; the median value was 2.49 μg/L. Both values are higher than in 2020 (mean = 2.86 μg/L, median = 1.88 μg/L). The maximum chlorophyll a concentration in 2021 was 25.51 μg/L, recorded in March at C10A. This is lower than the 2020 maximum (32.50 μg/L). The minimum for 2021 chlorophyll a concentration was 0.51 μg/L, recorded at C3A in November. It was nearly identical to the 2020 value (0.53 μg/L). Nine chlorophyll a samples were below the reporting limit.</p>
<p>The mean pheophytin a concentration for all samples in 2021 was 1.49 μg/L, slightly lower than the 2020 value (1.65 μg/L). The median value was 1.17 μg/L, nearly identical to the 2020 value (1.16 μg/L). The maximum pheophytin a concentration was 11.08 μg/L, recorded at NZ032 in April. This value was slightly lower than in 2020 (11.69 μg/L). The minimum pheophytin a concentration was 0.50 μg/L, which is equivalent to the reporting limit; this was recorded at D41 in September. Thirty-four pheophytin a samples were below the reporting limit; they were observed at various stations throughout the year.</p>

The highest concentration was recorded at NZ068 in April (5.12 µg/L) and the lowest was recorded at C3A in November (0.51 µg/L). The mean and median values were 2.09 μg/L and 1.55 μg/L, respectively. There were three samples below the detection limit.</p>
<p>Pheophytin a average concentrations were low throughout the year (below 1.5 µg/L); values were generally lower than chlorophyll a (Figure 3). The maximum (2.12 µg/L) was recorded at NZ068 in December and the minimum (0.56 µg/L) was recorded at C3A in November. There were seven samples below the detection limit, occurring at both stations in the region throughout the year. The mean and median were 1.09 µg/L and 0.93 µg/L, respectively.</p>
<p>Phytoplankton average densities were highest in spring and summer, with cyanobacteria dominating throughout the year (Figure 4; “other” are euglenoids, haptophytes, and synurophytes). There was a peak of cryptophytes in March, with smaller peaks occurring again in July and August. There was a small peak of diatoms in November.</p>

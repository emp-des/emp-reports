## Current Report {#phyto-report}

### Introduction

The Department of Water Resources (DWR) and the US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) are required by Water Right Decision 1641 (D-1641) to collect phytoplankton and chlorophyll *a* samples to monitor algal community composition and biomass at select sites in the upper San Francisco Estuary (Estuary). This report describes the results of these monitoring efforts for water year `r report_year_txt`, which was classified as a `r func_wy(report_year)` year in the Sacramento Valley [(source)](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/reportapp/javareports?name=WSIHIST).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Methods

Samples were collected monthly at 24 monitoring sites throughout the Upper Estuary and were grouped into regions based on their geographic location (Figure 1; Table 1). These sites represent a variety of aquatic habitats, from narrow, freshwater channels to broad, estuarine bays.

knitr::include_graphics(file.path('sections/phyto/figures/phyto_map.png'))
```

```{r echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results = 'asis', caption = capTab('Stations included within each region of the Delta')}
phyto_stations <- readr::read_csv('sections/phyto/figures/phyto-stations.csv')
kable_tables(phyto_stations)
```

#### Phytoplankton

The 10 most common genera were determined by summing the normalized organism counts across all stations and months for each genus. For the bar graphs, average organism counts were calculated per month, per region, and normalized to the number of stations. Average summary statistics are reported as the mean (μ) ± the standard deviation.

For more in-depth methodology, see [here](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=edi.1320.6).

#### Chlorophyll a and Pheophytin a

Samples of chlorophyll a and pheophytin a were collected monthly at 24 monitoring sites throughout the upper Estuary using a submersible pump positioned 1 meter below the water's surface. Average analyte concentrations were then calculated per month, per region, and were normalized to the number of stations. Average summary statistics are reported as the median (M) ± the median absolute deviation.

#### Pigment Concentrations

97.9% of samples had chlorophyll a levels below 10 μg/L. Chlorophyll a levels below 10 μg/L are considered limiting for zooplankton growth (Müller-Solger et al., 2002). Of the 7 samples with chlorophyll a concentrations equal to or above 10 μg/L, one occurred at NZ325 in April; three occurred in August (NZ002, NZ004, and NZ325); one occurred at NZ325 in February; one occurred at D10 in March; and one occurred at D41A in May.

The average chlorophyll a concentration was 2.08 ± x μg/L; this is lower than the `r func_wy(report_year)` year average (M = 2.37 ± x μg/L). Values ranged from \< 0.5 μg/L (the reporting limit) to 49.8 μg/L (NZ325 in August). 8 samples were below the reporting limit.

The average pheophytin concentration was 2.08 ± x μg/L; this is lower than the `r func_wy(report_year)` year average (M = 2.37 ± x μg/L). Values ranged from \< 0.5 μg/L (the reporting limit) to 49.8 μg/L (NZ325 in August). 8 samples were below the reporting limit.

```

##### Phytoplankton

Average algal group density (based on x number of stations) was x ± y organisms/mL. The most abundant algal groups were cyanobacteria (80% of organisms, μ = 1,595 ± x organisms/mL), diatoms (10% of organisms, μ = x ± y organisms/mL), and green algae (5% of organisms, μ = x ± y organisms/mL). The remaining 5% of organisms were comprised of chrysophytes, cryptophytes, dinoflagellates, euglenoids, haptophytes, and raphidophytes (“Other”, Figure x).

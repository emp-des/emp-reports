## Current Report {#dwq-report}

### Introduction

Water year 2020 was classified as Dry in the Sacramento Valley and San Joaquin Valley, unlike the previous year, which was classified as Wet [(source)](https://cdec.water.ca.gov/reportapp/javareports?name=WSIHIST). The 2019-2020 data from all stations within the same region were plotted on one graph and then combined with the graphs from other regions to make a facet graph for each parameter. Samples were not collected in April and May 2020 due to logistical issues caused by COVID-19. The minimum and maximum values in 2020 were determined for each field parameter or laboratory analyte to show the range within a single year. The instances when a result fell below the reporting limit were excluded from these minimum and maximum calculations. When this occurred, a vertical dashed line capped at the reporting limit was added to the graph to represent the presence of a non-detect.

### Specific Conductance

Specific conductance varied greatly in 2020 across the sampling regions with the highest levels occurring in the western regions (San Pablo Bay, Suisun & Grizzly Bays, Confluence) due to the salty waters from Pacific Ocean having a stronger influence. Specific conductance ranged from an average of 134 µS/cm (C3A in Northern Interior Delta, July) to 45,349 µS/cm (D41 in San Pablo Bay, November) during 2020. Higher specific conductance values were seen in 2020 (μ = 11,310 μS/cm) than in 2019 (μ = 6,702 μS/cm), which was likely due to the on-going drought keeping the San Francisco Estuary drier throughout the year.

### Turbidity

Turbidity values ranged from 0.3 FNU (D19 in Central Delta, March) to 41.4 FNU (D7 in Suisun & Grizzly Bays, Nov during 2020. The year 2020 had lower average turbidity than in 2019 (9.8 FNU vs. 19.6 FNU), possibly due to the relative lack of rain and snowpack runoff during the winter months due to drought. All six regions experienced a spike in turbidity in February 2019 when the first set of big storms hit, causing higher flows throughout the estuary and therefore a higher likelihood of increased sediment disturbance.

### Dissolved Ammonia

Dissolved ammonia levels in 2020 ranged from ≤ 0.05 mg/L (the reporting limit) in several regions to 0.7 mg/L (C3A in Northern Interior Delta, March and Jine). Dissolved ammonia levels are typically higher at C3A in the Northern Interior Delta due to its location downstream of the effluent discharge from Sacramento Regional Sanitation District. Ammonia levels are typically lower throughout the Delta and Bays, likely due to dilution and nitrification.

### Chlorophyll a

Chlorophyll a values in 2020 ranged from 0.53 µg/L (C3A in the Northern Interior Bay, November and NZ325 in San Pablo Bay, March) to 32.5 µg/L (C10A in Southern Interior Delta, July). The highest levels of chlorophyll a were seen in the Southern Interior Delta region during the summer months in 2020. This was mostly due to elevated levels at station C10A, which is known for being shallow during dry periods of the year, with increased temperatures and lower flows allowing for increased phytoplankton production. These elevated chlorophyll a levels in the summer at C10A also align with the continuous fluorescence data collected at this station. More information about the phytoplankton genera is described in the phytoplankton section. Average chlorophyll levels across all regions were similar in 2020 to those in 2019 (2.84 µg/L vs. 2.28 µg/L).

### Dissolved Nitrate + Nitrite

Dissolved nitrate + nitrite values ranged from ≤ 0.05 mg/L (the lowest reporting limit) to 3.5 mg/L (P8 in Southern Interior Delta, October) in 2020. The Southern Interior Delta region had the highest fluctuation of dissolved nitrate + nitrite concentrations and had the highest levels compared to the rest of the estuary, likely due to influence from nearby agricultural land use and wastewater treatment effluent. Reporting limits for dissolved nitrate + nitrate were as high as 7.5 and 15 mg/L for western regions in late 2019 due to chloride influence on the analytical method. These reporting limits were cropped out of graphs for scale.

### Total Phosphorus

In 2020, total phosphorous levels ranged from 0.04 mg/L (D28A in Central Delta, December) to 0.49 mg/L (P8 in Southern Interior Delta, September). Total phosphorus concentrations were overall similar compared to 2019 (both averaging 0.10 mg/L).

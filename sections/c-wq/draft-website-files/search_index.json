The stations provide continuous measurements of 6 water quality parameters and up to 4 environmental parameters at select locations. State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP) Operations and Maintenance staff use these measurements to assess impacts and to adjust operations as necessary to comply with mandated water quality standards. The CEMP has been in operation since 1983. This report summarizes the results of continuous water quality monitoring at 15 sites for calendar year 2021. The stations are categorized into five regions. (Table 1, Figure 1): Northern Interior Delta, Southern Interior Delta, Central Delta, Confluence, and Grizzly &amp; Suisun Bays. NOTE: CEMPs Sherman Island station (SSI), which was called D11A in previous reports, has been renamed D22A to better reflect its location in relation to historical station D22.

Each of the 15 monitoring stations collected continuous data for water temperature (WT), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), surface-specific conductance (SpC), chlorophyll a fluorescence, and turbidity. Additionally, sensors were installed at the Antioch, Mallard Island, and Martinez stations in the 1990s to monitor bottom SpC. Along with river stage data measured at the Mallard Island and Martinez stations, these bottom SpC measurements determine compliance with the mandated salinity standard (also known as X2) set by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) in the 1995 Bay-Delta Plan. Except for bottom-specific conductance, all water samples were collected 1-meter below the water surface using a float-mounted YSI EXO2 multi-parameter water quality sonde. In contrast, bottom-specific conductance was measured at 1.5 meters above the channel bottom using a YSI EXO1 sonde. Water quality data was recorded at 15-minute intervals. Parameter Units Frequency Water Temperature °C 15 minute instantaneous Specific Conductance µS/cm 15 minute instantaneous DO mg/L 15 minute instantaneous pH unitless 15 minute instantaneous Turbidity FNU 15 minute instantaneous Fluorescence µg/L 15 minute instantaneous Table 1: Parameters sampled by Continuous EMP QA Status Quality assurance and control measures were applied according to CEMPs Quality Assurance Project Plan (QAPP) (Appendix A). Only data validated as Good Data according to Section 22 of the QAPP were analyzed for this report. Regions The daily averages of the continuous 15-minute data collected for air and water temperature, pH, DO, surface and bottom SpC, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and turbidity for calendar year 2022 are shown in Figures 2 - 7. The range of monthly DO values at the Stockton station is shown below. Figure 1: Range of daily dissolved oxygen Rough and Ready Isl.

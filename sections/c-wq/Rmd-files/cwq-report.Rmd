### Methods
Continuous data were collected for the water quality and environmental parameters shown below. Each of the 15 monitoring stations collected continuous data for water temperature (WT), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), surface specific conductance (SpC), chlorophyll a fluorescence, and turbidity. Additional sensors were installed at the Antioch, Mallard Island, and Martinez stations in the 1990’s to monitor bottom SpC. These measurements, along with river stage data measured at the Mallard Island and Martinez stations, were needed to determine compliance with the salinity standard (also known as X2) that was mandated by the Bay-Delta Plan (SWRCB, 1995).
Environmental data, such as air temperature (AT), solar radiation (SRI), wind speed (WV), and wind direction (WD), were measured at all stations as part of D-1641’s Table 3 objectives (SWRCB, 1999). The only environmental parameter analyzed for this report was air temperature from a MET-1 Instrument Mod. 062 sensor.

Except for bottom SpC, all water samples were collected at 1-m below the water surface using a float-mounted YSI EXO2 multi-parameter water quality sonde. In contrast, bottom SpC was measured at 1.5 m above the channel bottom using a YSI EXO1 sonde. Water quality data and environmental data were recorded at 15-minute intervals.

### Regions
The daily averages of the continuous 15-minute data collected for air and water temperature, pH, DO, surface and bottom SpC, chlorophyll a fluorescence, and turbidity for calendar year 2019 are shown in Figures 2 to 8. The range of monthly DO values at the Stockton station is shown below. Data gaps in the daily plots result from days where more than 30% of the 15-minute data are flagged or unavailable.

#### Specific Conductance
Daily average surface specific conductance for the estuary ranged from 77 μS/cm to 26,944 μS/cm, with the lower values in the Southern Interior Delta stations and the higher values at the more tidally influenced Grizzly/Suisun Bay locations (Figure 3e).
All stations showed a decrease in specific conductance in late March (Figure 3a to 3e). The Northern Interior Delta station C3A and D24 showed a large jump in specific conductance for the months of January, February, March, November, and December 2019. In addition, the Southern Interior Delta stations on the San Joaquin River showed a significant decrease in surface specific conductance starting April June 2019 (Figure 3b). specific conductance from these 3 stations would remain low until the beginning of July.

Bottom SpC measured in 2019 at D12A, D10A, and D6A stations exhibited seasonal patterns and ranges similar to the surface SpC (Figure 3f).

All compliance monitoring stations recorded daily averages above the standard of 5.0 mg/L that was set by the CVRWQCB in the Basin Plan (CVRWQCB, 1998). The monthly average DO levels at the Stockton station did not fall below the 5.0 mg/L standard that was set by the CVRWQCB (1998).

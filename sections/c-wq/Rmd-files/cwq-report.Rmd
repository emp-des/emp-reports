### Methods
Continuous data were collected for the water quality and environmental parameters shown in Table 2. Each of the 15 monitoring stations collected continuous data for water temperature (WT), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), surface specific conductance (SpC), chlorophyll a fluorescence, and turbidity.  Additional sensors were installed at the Antioch, Mallard Island, and Martinez stations in the 1990’s to monitor bottom SpC. These measurements, along with river stage data measured at the Mallard Island and Martinez stations, were needed to determine compliance with the salinity standard (also known as X2) that was mandated by the Bay-Delta Plan (SWRCB, 1995). 

Environmental data, such as air temperature (AT), solar radiation (SRI), wind speed (WV), and wind direction (WD), were measured at all stations as part of D-1641’s  objectives (SWRCB, 1999). The only environmental parameter analyzed for this report was air temperature from a MET-1 Instrument Mod. 062 sensor. 

Except for bottom specific conductance, all water samples were collected at 1-m below the water surface using a float-mounted YSI EXO2 multi-parameter water quality sonde.  In contrast, bottom specific conductance was measured at 1.5 m above the channel bottom using a YSI EXO1 sonde. Water quality data and environmental data were recorded at 15-minute intervals.

#### Dissolved Oxygen
Average daily DO values in the estuary ranged from 5.94 mg/L to 15.1 mg/L. The greatest degree of variability was seen at the Southern Interior Delta stations.

All compliance monitoring stations recorded daily averages above the standard of 5.0 mg/L that was set by the CVRWQCB in the Basin Plan (CVRWQCB, 1998). The monthly average DO levels at the Stockton station did not fall below the 5.0 mg/L standard that was set by the CVRWQCB (1998). The monthly average DO levels did not drop below the 6.0 mg/L standard (SWRCB, 1995) for the passage of fall-run Chinook salmon through the ship channel for the September through November 2020 control period.

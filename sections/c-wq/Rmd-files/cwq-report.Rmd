### Methods
Continuous data were collected for the water quality shown in Table 2. Each of the 15 monitoring stations collected continuous data for water temperature (WT), pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), surface-specific conductance (SpC), chlorophyll a fluorescence, and turbidity. Additionally, sensors were installed at the Antioch, Mallard Island, and Martinez stations in the 1990’s to monitor bottom SpC. Along with river stage data measured at the Mallard Island and Martinez stations, these bottom SpC measurements determine compliance with the mandated salinity standard (also known as X2) set by the State Water Resources Control Board (SWRCB) in the 1995 Bay-Delta Plan. 
Except for bottom-specific conductance, all water samples were collected 1-meter below the water surface using a float-mounted YSI EXO2 multi-parameter water quality sonde. In contrast, bottom-specific conductance was measured at 1.5 meters above the channel bottom using a YSI EXO1 sonde. Water quality data was recorded at 15-minute intervals.

### Parameters
#### Water Temperature
Average daily water temperatures in the estuary ranged from 7.83 °C to 26.66°C, with the lower values occurring in the Northern Interior Delta location and the higher values found in the Southern Interior Delta stations.
Average daily water temperatures at the Northern Interior Delta stations were typically lower than those observed at the Southern Interior Delta stations. The most significant divergence occurred from July through September at the Southern Interior Delta locations.

#### Specific Conductance
Average daily surface-specific conductance for the estuary ranged from 74 µS/cm to 33,077 µS/cm. The lower values were observed at the Northern Interior Delta stations and the higher at the more tidally influenced Grizzly/Suisun Bay locations (Figure 3e). In response to extreme precipitation and runoff events, most stations showed significant decreases in specific conductance values in October and December. 

Bottom-specific conductance measured in 2021 at D12A, D10A, and D6A stations exhibited seasonal patterns and ranges similar to the surface-specific conductance values.

#### Dissolved Oxygen
Average daily DO values in the estuary ranged from 6.09 mg/L to 15.81 mg/L (Figures 4a to 4e). The most significant variability was observed at the Southern Interior Delta stations.
All compliance monitoring stations recorded daily averages above the 5.0 mg/L standard set by the CVRWQCB in the Basin Plan (CVRWQCB, 1998). The monthly average DO levels at the Stockton station did not fall below the 5.0 mg/L standard set by the CVRWQCB (1998). In addition, the monthly average DO levels did not drop below the 6.0 mg/L standard (SWRCB, 1995) for the passage of fall-run Chinook salmon through the ship channel for the September through November control period.

# Continuous Water Quality {#cwq}

## Background {.unlisted}

The Continuous Environmental Monitoring Program (CEMP) provides real-time quarter-hourly water quality from 15 automated sampling stations in the estuary (Figure 1). The stations provide continuous measurements of 6 water quality parameters and up to 4 environmental parameters at select locations. State Water Project (SWP) and the Central Valley Project (CVP) Operations and Maintenance staff use these measurements to assess impacts and to adjust operations as necessary to comply with mandated water quality standards. The CEMP has been in operation since 1983.
